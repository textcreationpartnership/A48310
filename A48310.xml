         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOme account may perhaps be expected to be given of this ſmall
endeavour, touching the paſsing that Act of clearing the doubt touching
Coercive Power in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; wherein is that
<hi>Proviſo</hi> that <hi>forbids all Eccleſiaſticall Judges to tender or
admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter an Oath to any perſon</hi> Ex Officio <hi>or otherwiſe,
or</hi> Purgation; <hi>whereby any perſon may confeſſe or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
himſelf, ſo as to make him or her liable to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or
puniſhment.</hi> There were not a few perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends at leaſt to the
Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that inſulted much (as is
touched hereafter) and clamoured of the oppreſsion of the Eccleſiaſtical
Courts, that hath been (ſay they) all the time before the paſsing of that
Act, that took away that Oath: It was ſuitable to their intereſt to call
that oppreſsion. When <hi>Brutus</hi> had murdered <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he
called him Tyrant; <hi>Ita enim appellari Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem facto ejus
expediebat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Velleius Paterculus, Hiſtor. lib. 2.</hi> From
the time of paſsing that Act, till within theſe few dayes, I expected from
abler pens ſome Vindication of the proceedings of Eccleſiaſticall Courts,
as touching ſuch <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Canonical Purgation,</hi> and the
lawful and expedient uſe thereof before that Act; but none that I hear of
attempting it: I looked upon the cauſe as a Derelict, took it up, and though
(by the late iniquity of the times) I being too much ſeverall wayes
unfurniſhed for ſuch a Work; yet, if but to give ſome ſatisfaction to
indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent men, and to wipe away at leaſt in part cauſeleſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and to ſtir up others to a further proſecution hereof; I conceived I might
adventure upon this little Modell or Plat-form, and perhaps more fitly at this
time then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <pb facs="tcp:52848:5"/>till a more complete Structure may be raiſed
upon this ſubject, if more be needful; being ſo learnedly and fully
handled, eſpecially by Doctor <hi>Coſens</hi> ſometimes Dean of the
<hi>Arches,</hi> and that late glory of our Church Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi>
late Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> That I ſhould eſcape from
objections and cenſures too, I can ſcarce ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, upon ſuch a
Subject as this is, ingrateful to ſuch men as are <hi>haeredes ex
aſſe,</hi> to the ancient oppoſers of it, and are inveighers againſt
it; and thoſe that executed it, <hi>quos lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerint, oderint,</hi> alwayes
excepting the Members of both Houſes of Parliament out of that number. Some
too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may diſlike my Dedication of it (though no Act more free then
that) as not to ſome of my own profeſsion, or rather to my own moſt
Learned and Pious Dioceſan, the Reverend Father in God, Doctor <hi>Robert
Sanderſon</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> having relation to him by
<hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Truſt:</hi> To him and them I ſhould rather have
made my addreſſe then Dedication, and have herein conſulted with them,
had time and convenience ſerved before I had attempted this, and not carry
Owles to <hi>Athens,</hi> go about to give inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, from whom I
ſhould rather have received it. But as to that most Noble Perſon, to whom
this is inſcribed, though according to his Birth and Education, his motion
hath alwayes been in an higher Orbe and Contemplation of affaires of greater
moment, more immediately enabling him to ſerve his King and Country: But
(they by being ſomewhat more particularly concerned in a great part of the
ſubject matter hereof) therefore by ſome may be ſuppoſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and
intereſſed. Yet even in the ſubject matter of theſe <hi>Memoranda</hi>
he is not unverſed, if not more particularly; yet as comprehended in that
generality of Learning and Knowledge, whereto he hath from his younger yeares
been habituated to, at the feet of ſuch a States-man, as was his <pb facs="tcp:52848:5"/>moſt accompliſhed Father, and ſuch Inſtructors as he by his
eſpecial and moſt diſcerning choice appointed him; and all this perfected
up by moſt advantagious acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by travel and reſidence in forraign
parts, amongſt thoſe who are juſtly ranked in the number of the moſt
Civil, Learned, and Wiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo conſequently in the
Univerſe; and ſo need not mine or others inſtruction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more then
others, not profeſſed Lawyers. But all that is compriſed in this Model,
both in the <hi>Memoranda's</hi> and the <hi>Notes,</hi> ſomewhat grounded
upon ſome yeares experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I have had, and tending, as before, at leaſt
in my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning opinion to the publick good ſolely; is ſo moſt humbly
offered to conſideration, if by thoſe in Authority it be thought fit. He
is, I conceive, very fit to further and advance this, both in conſideration
of his abilities, and his being impowred as others of his noble rank and
quality in the Supreme Judicatory of this Kingdom; and by his own Genius and
propenſity, willing and deſirous to effect any thing ayming that way, as
leſs cannot be expected from the Son of ſuch a Father, and Husband of
ſuch a wife, his moſt noble and moſt vertuous Lady, (a pair in reſpect
of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual parity of their moſt intenſe conjugal affection, and
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentizing love to Loyalty, Juſtice and Honour, hereditary vertues flowing
in their veines from their moſt Noble Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Gloriouſly Acting and
Suffering Parents; not eaſily parallel'd) and therefore I have not ſo much
Dedicated this to him, as ſupplicated his effectual adminicular hand
hereto.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter as touching my ſelf, this Modell, as
alſo, if not more eſpecially <hi>the Notes</hi> ſubjoyn'd; I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had
no ſmall ſhare of Sufferings in the time of exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Monarch and
Monarchy, and ſo conſequently of joy and gladneſs in the happy
Reſtauration of both; in my due gratitude and obligation, both by tie of
natural duty, <pb facs="tcp:52848:6"/>and of God and Mans Laws, have made it part of my
ſtudy to endeavour to contribute my well-meaning mite to the publick good,
and the prevention of ſuch miſeries for the future, as too lately we have
had too ſad experience of. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be given of many that have
publiſhed their endeavours heretofore to ſuch publick ends, which have not
proved ineffectual, and more eſpecially Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
State of <hi>Ireland</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. If in any
meaſure never ſo remote, they may any whit help to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that end they
aime at; I ſhall be glad of it, and with that true candour ſubmiſsively
offering them, alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting as I now do, that if there be any thing
herein, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods word directly or indirectly, or to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Prerogative, or the known Laws of the Land, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical or Temporal, or
the politick Government either in Church or State, or which may give juſt
offence: I do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abſolutely retract it, as no wayes by me intended or
thought of, wiſhing this ſmall taſte may ſtir up others (more able) to
make a further and better progreſs in this kind.</p>

vehemently if not violently, and <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52848:10"/>as before that time ſome
Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany</hi> had done the like in ſuch Caſes. Of their
practiſes that way here, that moſt Faithful, Learned, and Grave Hiſtorion
of ours, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> gives us an account in his Annals of the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> printed at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the Low-Countries 1625.
It is in the year 1590. After he hath there given a Relation of that
ſtupendious and blaſphemous Fanatick <hi>Hackett, of his beginning, how
illiterate, inſolent, fierce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful he was, that meeting one that
had been his School-Maſter an ingenuous perſon, under a colour of embracing
him bit off his Noſe, and the poor miſerable deformed man, beſeeching him
to give it him again, that whilſt it was green and freſh he might ſow it
again to his face; he would not do it, but like a dogge ſwallowed it down;
and ſo averſe was he to all piety, that, that heavenly Doctrine he had
heard in Sermons, he made ſport with it, with his pot-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions on the
Ale-benches. Afterwards when he had prodigally waſted his Eſtate which he
had got with a Widow whom he had marryed; on a ſudain he claps on the vizard
of moſt specious ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, is wholly taken up in hearing Sermons, reading
the Scriptures, and pretending to I know not what, heavenly Revelations, and
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting an extraordinary calling, inſinuated himſelf into the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of ſeverall Divines, that with inflamed zeal, labour'd to bring
in the Presbyteriall Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> Geneva, <hi>into the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>amongst whom was one</hi> Wigginton <hi>a

                  </gap>er of Magiſtrates.</hi> Then he goes
on and relates <hi>Hacketts</hi> and his Complices moſt horrid and ridiculous
madneſs, ſuch as had not ſuch a worthy Author and others related it, we
might now doubt of the truth of it, as the next Age will probably do of our
Modern Fanaticks late pranks: there he relates his fearful blaſphemous
ſpeeches, as he expired and was turn'd off the Gallowes, upon whom that pious
and Learned Author gives this grave cenſure, <hi>Ita hoſtis humani gencris,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentat quos ſanctitatem ſimulare, &amp; ad ſolrietatem nolle ſapere
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendit.</hi> Thus the enemy of Mankinde infatuates thoſe whom he
perceives to be counterfeitors of holineſs, and will not be wiſe with
ſobriety.</p>

Queen could not by Law delegate ſuch kinde of Authority, nor others to whom
it was delegated could exerciſe it. That theſe Courts could not require the
Oath <hi>ex officio</hi> from the defendent party, when as no man is bound to
accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. That Oath precipitates men to condemn themſelves with
ignominious confuſion, or into wilful perjury to the deſtruction of their
Souls. Beſides, they ought not to hold cognizance of any other cauſes then
Matrimoniall and Teſtamentary, according to that old Mandate or Reſcript,"
<hi>We command our Sheriff of our Counties of</hi> S. N. <hi>&amp;c. that they
ſuffer not any in their Balive to come together in any places, to make any
Recognizances upon their Oaths, but in Matrimoniall and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52848:11"/>cauſes.</hi> "On the other ſide the Profeſſors of
the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes maintain'd, the Royall Authority in Cauſes
Eccleſiaſticall as veſted in the Queen by Authority of Parliament. To
oppoſe this, was nothing elſe then to offer violence to Royall Majeſty,
and violating the Oath of obedience, to inſult over the Sacred Prerogative
Royall. The Eccleſiaſticall Courts may hold cognizance of other Cauſes,
then Matrimoniall and Teſtamentary, by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Circumſpecte
agatis</hi> and <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the
firſt as they made it appeare. That Reſcript or Law which they produc'd was
ſuſpected, becauſe it was incertain for the time, and is variouſly
read. Elſewhere I have read it, <hi>To perform Recogniſances and
Oaths,</hi> and to make recognition or recognizance, doth not ſignifie to
give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, or to anſwer in Law, but to acknowledge and confeſſe a
debt, or to hold plea of Inventaries or Debts. That the Oath <hi>ex
officio</hi> hath time out of mind been given in theſe Courts as in others,
to ſift out Simonie, Adultery, and other works of darkneſs; eſpecially,
when the Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation as they call it, becomes loude." <hi>And though no man
is bound to betray himſelf, yet being betrayed by fame, he is bound to ſhew
himſelf whether he can defend his innocence and purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeeing
the penance enjoyned is not a puniſhment, but a medicine to cure ſinners,
and to deter others from ſinning, and to take away ſcandall,</hi> according
to that in Scripture, <hi>Be not confounded in speaking truth for thy ſouls
ſake, for there is a confuſion that brings ſin, and there is a
confuſion that brings glory and grace.</hi> "But what do I dwelling upon
theſe things, when the Learned diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hereupon on both ſides are
extant of <hi>Richard Coſin</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Lawes, and <hi>John
Morris,</hi> and <hi>Lancelot Andrewes?</hi> The Queen not ignorant that Her
Authority was in this buſineſs ſtruck at through the ſides of the
Biſhops, tacitely cruſh'd the violence of the Adverſaries, and
conſerv'd the Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction inviolate."</q> Thus in a

diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gives his ſound judgement thereupon. But ſtill they
went on in their deſign, in which I believe they will ever be found
immoveable. We have had ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52848:12"/>that way at
what they aime, and that there is no hope of bending without breaking too. In
their admonition to the Parliament in that Queens Reign they tell us, to this
effect at leaſt, that if they cannot have what they deſire by fair meanes,
they will have it by a way ſhall make our hearts ake; and I think they have
indifferently well made their words good. Yet bleſſed be God, we are

along the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and upon King <hi>James</hi> his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, thinking upon that change to have wrought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary upon a Prince that had a great acceſs of Dominion, and probably
at his entrance would endeavour to ſatisfie all or moſt, ſo far as with
reaſon it could be expected, and to ingratiate himſelf as far as fitting
with his new Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But it was our happineſs, though his trouble and
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation, that he was well acquainted with the factious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
humours of that gang in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (with whom and ours here of the
ſame mould, I believe ever was and will be a correſpondence and
co-operation.) <hi>Ex viridi obſervantia</hi> this is too demonſtrable.
They then ſet upon King <hi>Iames</hi> with their moſt humble Petition,
called <hi>The Lincoln-ſhire Miniſters Petition,</hi> perhaps
<hi>denominatio à majori;</hi> it was a complication of many parts:
there they deſire favour for tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and thereupon was the
Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> granted, where their Reaſons were, as it
were, <hi>brayed in a Mortar,</hi> and they or moſt of them ſeem'd
ſatisfied; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at leaſt, ſoon returned to their vomit. In
that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they promiſe all obedience, and profeſs they hold it
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Word, and the practice of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to
reſiſt the Prince, or to get Reformation by force or <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52848:12"/>violence. To this effect they ſupplicate and hold forth; yet I
believe it may be prov'd, that ſome of theſe individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in that
Petition, adhered expreſly to the late Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Majeſty, if
they were not actually in Arms againſt him, as moſt if not all of their
Opinions were. How they crept in, or rather marched on furiouſly, though
ſlily in the the late Kings time, till they had weav'd up their Web to their
deſire: we have ſeen and ſadly felt. When the High-Commiſſion and
Star-Chamber were taken away, a great point was gain'd: To ſpeak of nothing
elſe but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon which I am. Yet by the way it is obſervable,
that many, if not moſt, moderate men are of opinion, that the Government will
not be well ſettled, till both theſe Courts, though happily in many
particulars altered and regulated, or
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſome other Courts much like
them, be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; where extraordinary crimes and perſons may be
order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and in the former, the High-Commiſſion, the ſhifting of
criminous perſons from one Dioceſe to another may be met with. It was no
ſmall part of their deſign, to trample upon Eccleſiaſtical
Juriſdiction, and to take away the coercive power, and to make it precarious
and ridiculous: as they would interpret that Statute, which, if credible
relations be true, was but ſtrangely got; inſomuch that a great leading
Member in the Houſe of Commons then in that long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cryed out,
<hi>Digitus Dei fuit in eo;</hi> that though it were not intended, yet the
words would bear it, which he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at; though many, and not of the
leaſt, able Lawyers in the Kingdom were not of his opinion. That Coercive
pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for no other have the Eccleſiaſtick Courts, (except
<hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenſion,</hi> a degree below it, which amounts but to a ſmall
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion to refractory perſons, in regard it goes no further, the ſecular
arme cannot be called upon that;) that, I ſay, that coercive power is
<hi>Excommunication.</hi> That is the power of the Keyes, how far that power
may be ſtaid, retarded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, I intend not to diſpute; but that it
ſhall be totally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Church, <hi>Quaſi non eſſet Deus
in coelis,</hi> that ſurely is not to be believed, that it can be done by any
power under Heaven. But that taking away that coercive power <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52848:13"/>from the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, as they interpreted it, (and they
knew they had <hi>argumentum à fortiori</hi> to maintain it) did not a
little further and heighten their deſign. At the time of their raiſing
their Militia againſt the late King, a perſon of no mean quality at a great
Aſſembly made his Harangue to the people, (as I heard it from a very
credible perſon, who ſaid he was then and there preſent and heard it) and
then and there enumerated the many great bleſſings this Nation had received
from that bleſſed Parliament, (as he call'd it) That Ship-money was taken
away, and the Star-Chamber was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the High-Commiſſion was
taken away, and the Spiritual Courts too are taken away: A man could not meddle
with a Wench, (his expreſſion was otherwiſe, which I am not willing to
mention) but he muſt be queſtion'd: <hi>Hinc illae lacrymae.</hi> Indeed
that was a great Eye-ſore. Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents never love the Judges that puniſh
them.</p>
            <q>At laus ſumma, viris displicuiſſe malis.</q>
            <p>And this did not a little advantage the cauſe they had then in
hand, very many perſons that had been juſtly queſtion'd in theſe Courts
flocking in to their colours. But I take no delight to rekon up theſe
ſtrange paſſages, (to call them no worſe) which were not a few when
that ſtorm was in raiſing, which afterwards ſhaked all the corners of the
Land. Two onely which concerned Eccleſiaſtical proceedings, (to meddle with
no other of higher nature, that the world rang of, and I would the memory of
them could be perpetually aboliſhed) I ſhall briefly touch, which amongſt
others were theſe: A grave and able Civilian, and then a Member of the
Houſe of Commons, was accuſed by an Inconformiſt, that he had
excommunicated him, for not kneeling at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion when he received. I was
preſent, and ſaw and heard it, and to my beſt remembrance it was for not
kneeling at the Communion, at leaſt it was for not performing ſome other
Ceremony; ſo that as to this matter 'tis all one. The Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian being called
up to a Committee of the Lords, then in the Long Parliament, out of the Houſe
of Commons, to anſwer <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52848:13"/>it. By his Counſel he deſir'd
time to ſend into the Countrey, where it was pretended to be done, to know
whether he had done any ſuch thing; it being impoſſible for him to
remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber every particular that he had done in his Juriſdiction, and that
particular, he ſaid, he did not remember. He had time given, and informed
himſelf thereof; and at the next appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of his appearance, by his
Counſel, pleaded that he had done no ſuch thing, as he was accuſed of.
The Accuſer ſaid, then it was done by his Deputy or Surrogate: That was
denyed too. Then he ſaid, he was ſure it was done by the Spiritual Court;
and ſo it was, but not by any Spiritual Court where that Civilian had to do:
Then the Civilian pleaded, that if he had done that whereof he was accuſed,
he doubted not but he could have juſtified it: but ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that
he was unjuſtly accus'd, and reap'd ſome diſcredit by being thus
queſtion'd, and had been put to trouble and charge thereabouts, he deſired
reparation and charges: which by many of the Lords was yielded to, yet by the
major part it was carried, that he ought not to have it; and the reaſon was
rendred, becauſe it would deter others from complaining. 
<q>Si ſatis eſt accuſaſſe, quis erit innocens?</q> Nay, how
far may it tend to the ruine of ſome, if ſome men be maliciouſly ſet
upon them, to multiply accuſations againſt them?</p>
            <p>The other was: Another Inconformiſt complaining of his being
queſtion'd in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts for his Inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: In defence
it was alledged againſt him and proved, that he had ſaid, <hi>He would as
ſoon bow at the name of</hi> Judas, <hi>as at the Name of</hi> JESUS: and I
diligently enquir'd, but never heard he was puniſh'd for it. But would there
had been no more then theſe, though theſe are too much: Would ſome had
not gloried, had not triumphed in their ſhame.</p>

confuted. The validity of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws. The clamours of
Inconformiſts, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators and Fanaticks, againſt the putting of
Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws in execution, though the Eccleſiaſtical Officers
and Ministers are by Act of Parliament ſeverely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do it.</head>
            <p>BY the late Act before mentioned, where the <hi>Doubt</hi> (ſo it
is called there) about the Coercive power in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts is
clear'd and taken away.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Proviſo</hi> is, <hi>That that Act, nor any thing therein
conteined, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to extend, to give unto any
Archbiſhop or Biſhop, or any other Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Judge,
&amp;c. any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or authority to exerciſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any be peccant that way, it ought to be amended.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Proviſo forbids any Archbiſhop, Biſhop, &amp;c. to
tender or adminiſter unto any perſon the Oath uſually called the
Oath</hi> Ex officio, <hi>or any other Oath, whereby ſuch perſon, to whom
the ſame is tendred or adminiſtred, may be charged or compelled to
confeſs or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or to purge him or her ſelf of any criminal matter or
thing, whereby he or ſhe may be lyable to any cenſure or
puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being now forbidden by Act of Parliament, every Subject ought
to give obedience therein: But ſome now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and upbraiding the
Eccleſiaſtical Courts, that all this while they have oppreſſed the
Subject, with that proceeding which the Parliament hath taken away, renewing
the old cry in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and ever ſince againſt
ſuch procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which never till now (I alwayes except what was done in
the late times of uſurped government) were legally prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52848:14"/>Though I am far from queſtioning the reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
that Act paſſed, but do humbly ſubmit to it both in word and practice;
yet I hope it will be allowed to make ſome defence againſt ſuch
perſons, as ſo tax ſuch proceedings before the paſſing of this Act.
And herein I ſhall follow that moſt able Civilian, <hi>Richard Coſin</hi>
Doctor of the Laws, and Dean of the Arches, in that his <hi>Apology for
ſundry proceedings by Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cambden,</hi> as before, mentions him with honour, as ſurely he well
deſerv'd, and that work of his, if nothing elſe, evinces it. Mr.
<hi>Swinburn</hi> in that Work of his of <hi>Laſt Wills and
Teſtaments,</hi> printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for the Company of Stationers,
1611. in the firſt part, ſect. 6. numb. 8. fol. 17. writes thus of him, and
of that Work of his, that Apology: <hi>I find,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>written by
that learned and no leſs religious man, Doctor</hi> Coſins <hi>(as I take
it) in that worthy Work entituled, An Apology for ſundry proceedings by
Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he goes on. Upon this
ſubject he hath written ſo fully, that, I believe, little can be added to
it; and if any ſhould go about it (excepting ſuch additions as well may be
added, by reaſon of ſome emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſince the time he wrote, and ſome
other additions and explications, not derogatory from him) they would be forced
very much to plough with his Heyfer, which would but look too much like a
Plagiary. I could wiſh the book were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and haply it will be ſo,
which may ſerve for Topicks to this ſubject. For as all the Poets after
<hi>Homer</hi> are ſaid to drink of his Fountain, according to that picture
or ſtatue of his, that denotes as much, with that Inſcription, 
<q>Ridet anhelantem poſt ſe veſtigia turbam.</q> Even ſo
muſt, I conceive, all do from Doctor <hi>Coſin,</hi> that ſhall write
upon this ſubject. I was upon Epitomizing that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of his, and had made
ſome progreſs therein; but upon ſecond thoughts deſiſted, thinking it
better to refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, rather then to adventure to abbreviate him,
and thereby perhaps wrong him: an offence that too many Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizers are guilty
of; therefore, I ſay, I ſhall onely make <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52848:15"/>uſe of
ſome Notes, as confeſſed arrows out of his quiver, and ſippe of ſome
others elſewhere, and point the Reader to his full ſtream, where any that
liſt may drink their fill.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe words in the late Act; <hi>Provided, that this Act.,
nor any thing therein contained, ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
or give unto any Archbiſhop, Biſhop, &amp;c. any power or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to
exerciſe or execute, &amp;c. any juriſdiction which they might not have
done before the year of our Lord</hi> 1639. <hi>or to abridge or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
the Kings Majeſtics Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters or affairs, nor
to confirm the Canons made in the year</hi> 1640.</p>
            <p>I ſay, upon theſe words ſome are ready (miſtaking
queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs the words and meaning of that Act) to renew that old exploded
Opinion, or rather groundleſs Fancy, <hi>That a ſeveral Royal aſſent to
the executing of every particular Canon is required.</hi> Hereto Doctor
<hi>Coſin</hi> anſwers, That admitting this were true, then all the other
opinions of thoſe that oppugn the ordinary Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical
ſtand in no ſtead, and might be ſpared, becauſe this would cut off all
at once. For none that exerciſe ordinary Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical,
have it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity, (which by the oppugners ſeems to be meant)
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by permiſſion of Law, to every of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and
impoſſible were it, by reaſon of the infinity of it, and
troubleſomneſs to procure ſuch particular aſſent to the execution of
every Canon. His Majeſties Delegates, when Appeals are made to His Majeſty
in Chancery, would ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, could not exerciſe the power to them
delegated, by reaſon of the want of ſuch particular aſſent; and it is a
groſs abſurdity to grant, (as even the Oppugners and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators do)
<hi>That Teſtamentary and Matrimonial cauſes are of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
cognizance,</hi> (to ſay nothing of the reſt of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cauſes) and yet cannot by reaſon of this want be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor can be
dealt in by any other authority, according to any Law in force. This would
ſpeak a defect in the publick Government, that the Subject ſhould have a
right, but no likely or ready mean to come by it; and great offences by Law
puniſhable, and yet no man ſufficiently authorized to execute theſe Laws.
Since the abrogation of Papal pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Supremacy, when the ancient rights of
the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52848:15"/>of being <hi>Supreme
Governors over all perſons within their Dominions, as well in all Spiritual
or Eccleſiaſtical things or cauſes, as Temporal; and that no forreign
Prince, Perſon, Prelate, State or Potentate, hath or ought to have, any
juriſdiction, power, ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, preeminence or authority
Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual within this Realm, and ſo forth,</hi> as in
the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since theſe rights were, as it were, <hi>ex poſtliminio</hi>
reſtored, and declared to have been, as they ever ought to have been, in the
Kings of <hi>England,</hi> many Laws have been made in ſeveral Parliaments
for the ſtrengthning of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more
effectual execution thereof, and ſome of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws were
enlarged, aſtered and explained:

been made for the ſtrengthning of Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and the
more effectual execution of it; and ſome of theſe Laws were enlarged,
altered and explained. But never was there any Law, Cuſtom or Act of
Parliament, that required <hi>a ſeveral Royal aſſent to the executing of
every particular Canon.</hi> Many are the reaſons which Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi>
gives in the firſt Chapter of his Apology againſt that <hi>particular
Aſſent;</hi> 
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52848:16"/>wherein he ſhews his great candor, and
ingenuity, and deſire to give abundant ſatisfaction to all Opponents,
though never ſo unreaſonable, that were it not as clear as the Noon-tide
light, that no ſuch particular aſſent is needful, ſome might think that
he fear'd his cauſe, and be ready to ſay, that <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio nimis
operoſa, reatum quaſi arguit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But touching the validity of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, there
needs, I conceive, no more be ſaid then what is expreſſed in that Act of
Parliament 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8.19. the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, that were in uſe
and practice before that Statute, are thereby eſtabliſhed thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provided that ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions, Ordinances and
Synods Provincial, being already made, which be not contrariant nor repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Laws, Statutes and Cuſtoms of this Realm, nor to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or hurt
of the Kings Prerogative Royal, ſhall now ſtill be uſed and executed, as
they were before the making of this Act, untill ſuch time as they be viewed,
&amp;c. by the</hi> 32. <hi>perſons mentioned in that Act:</hi> which is not
yet done.</p>
            <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Laws, which have been made ſince that Act,
and all that ever hereafter ſhall be made, ſo long as that Statute ſtands
in force, (the requiſites in that Act being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) are thereby, I
conceive, confirmed, or to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Submiſſion and Petition of
the Clergy mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Act is, <hi>That they would not enact or put in
ure any new Canons, &amp;c. in their Convocation, without the Kings Royal
aſſent and authority in that behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There it is ſaid, That <hi>the Convocation in the time coming
ſhall alwayes be aſſembled by authority of the Kings Writ, and that the
Clergy muſt have the Kings moſt Royal aſſent and licence, to make,
promulge, and execute ſuch Canons, Conſtitutions and Ordinances, Provincial
and Synodal:</hi> elſe they may not enact, promulge or conſtitute any
ſuch Canons, &amp;c. And this courſe hath ever ſince been obſerved.
Every Convocation called by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Writ and the Clergy, had
eſpecial licenſe from His Majeſty to enact ſuch Canons, &amp;c. and to
execute them.</p>
            <p>The Proviſion following being obſerved, which is this,
<hi>Provided that no Canons, Conſtitutions or Ordinances, ſhall be made or
put in execution in this Realm by authority of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52848:16"/>of the Clergy, which ſhall be contrariant or repugnant to
tho Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, or the Cuſtoms, Laws or Statutes of this Realm, any
thing contained in that Act to the contrary thereof
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any be put in execution contrary to this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and
contrary to any after-Acts of Parliament, whereby His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hath further
power acknowledged in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, then 'tis illegal: but that
is much ſooner alledged than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The particular Eccleſiaſtical Laws
in force, have by Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> and others been ſufficiently
demonſtrated, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive. In caſe any Juriſdiction
Eccleſiaſtical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil within this Realm, be not derived or claimed from
the Crown, as to the execution of it at leaſt; then the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
were of force; but another Act of Parliament, 8 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. ſhews
the contrary ſufficiently: where all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is
acknowledged United to the Crown, as there fully: and that very clauſe 1
<hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. together with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Letters Patents directed forth
for confirming Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Biſhops, is brought in the preamble thereof
as a ſtrong proof, without ſcruple or ambiguity, that <hi>the authority and
juriſdiction by the Clergy executed, is thereby given them from Her
Majeſty.</hi> This alſo, were there nothing elſe, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to
entitle them the Kings Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Laws, as well as other
Laws, are called the Kings Majeſties Laws. But they are up and down in the
Acts of Parliament called the Kings and the Queens Eccleſiaſtical Laws, 1
<hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 2. 5 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 25. 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8.27.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and even by the Note-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, that great oppugner, againſt
whom the Doctor wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, they are called <hi>the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of
England.</hi> And in this late Act above mentioned they are called <hi>the
Kings Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet for executing of theſe Laws by the Eccleſiaſtical Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
what out-cries were made againſt them? eſpecially in the beginning of the

            <p>Touching the <hi>Proviſo's</hi> in that late Act, that which

was juſt cauſe for the Eccleſiaſtical Judge ſo to tender and
adminiſter that Oath; that is, that there was, before ſuch oath was ſo
adminiſtred or tendered to any party, due proof made of a common fame, that
the party was guilty of ſuch crime, touching which ſuch oath was to be
adminiſtred; or at leaſt there was, as in ſome caſes, <hi>denunciatio
Evangelica,</hi> or <hi>canonica,</hi> or <hi>inſinuatio clamoſa,</hi> or
other ſufficient <hi>indicia prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionis</hi> or
<hi>ſuspicionis,</hi> to induce the Judge to tender that oath; and ſo the
practice alwayes was, and if it ever was otherwiſe, (as I believe that will
ſcarcely be proved) it ought not to have been. He ſets down the due
cautions that ought to be had, when it is very probable that the perſon to
whom that oath is tendered, will forſwear himſelf, then to forbear it; and
that in capital crimes, to the danger of loſs of life or limb, it is not the
practice in any Courts to adminiſter ſuch oath, for that very fear of
Perjury; it being too much to be feared, that too too many would rather
forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then endanger either life or limb, (though in ſome
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture it appears, that even in ſuch caſes ſuch oaths have
been adminiſtred.) The Father of lies could ſpeak truth in ſuch a

            <p>As for tendering the Oath to the party where there is an accuſer,
that is not done upon the crime till the fame be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or ſufficient

            <p>This practice he proves conſonant to Gods Word, to the practice of
the primitive Chriſtian, and the opinion of the holy Doctors and Fathers of
the Church; as alſo conſonant to the practice of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other
at leaſt ſeemingly ſtrictly reformed Churches: and to the practice of all
Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Nations not Chriſtian, guided onely by right 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52848:22"/>reaſon and the Law of Nature: as alſo that by the known
Laws of this Land, the Eccleſiaſtical Judges were ſo warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and
commanded to give that oath: the Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Canons being full
and clear in that point. Then he ſhews how the proceeding at Common Law in
this Land is the ſame, not onely in ſome criminal but civil cauſes
alſo. For private debts 'twixt private perſons penal to them, as in Wagers
of Law, ſometimes for a greater, ſometimes a leſſer debt, 'twixt two
private parties, with the parties oath that is accuſed, and his Compurgators
too; even as in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation Canonical in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, together
with other Purgation or Deciſory Oaths at Common Law. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in
Chancery, with the ſeveral ſpecies and kinds of caſes, wherein ſuch
Oaths at Common Law are tendered, being very numerous, and are by him
<hi>cap.</hi> 6. in the third part of his Apology, and other parts thereof
reckoned up, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth. And if this may be done in civil cauſes,
ought it not much rather be allowed the Church in criminal, which works onely,
<hi>medicinaliter,</hi> to reformation? the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth works <hi>ad
poenam,</hi> the Church not ſo; this to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the party, to bring
him to a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to take away the offence and
ſcandal which he hath juſtly given to his Neighbour, and to lead a new

the Magiſtrate. For ſurely it were hard, if every private man might require
an oath of the queſtioned, and not the Magiſtrate: ſhould it be lawful in
the caſe of a Pawn, and not of a Kingdom? An oath is an end of
controverſie, ſaith St. <hi>Paul;</hi>

then an oath to be taken for that end. In a caſe Matrimonial, which is meerly
Eccleſiaſtical, Interrogatories were adminiſtred with oath, (as in a

Enquiry, without any accuſer at all. And this which is to be noted in the

In ſome of theſe above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned inſtances, we ſee how oaths were
adminiſtred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in capital cauſes, much more may they be where there is
not that danger, nay, no danger of loſſe of Goods, Liberty, or any other
loſſe; but onely for a medicine to the ſoul, for reformation of manners,
and taking away ſcandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given. They were queſtioned too, we
ſee, upon ſmall ſuſpicions, ſigns, preſumptions, or any other
cauſes of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nay, nothing at all as to the perſon queſtioned,
upon whom no true colour of ſuſpicion lay, (ſomething like our Coroners
proceedings in ſome caſes) but onely a fact was committed, that was
apparent, whereof it was poſſible that he was not guilty, as in the caſe
of a perſon found ſlain; then much more ought it to be upon great

Laws and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices have been confirmed, not being contrariant to the Kings

Eccleſiaſtical Laws, it is ſo far from being contrariant, that it is
moſt conſonant, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commanded by the Temporal Laws of the
Land. ſay, it appearing by the Acts and Records of Eccleſiaſtical Courts,
that ſuch proceedings were ſo conſtantly upon oath; there needs no more
be ſaid for juſtification thereof, but it may ſafely be concluded, that
(before the making of that late Act) the Common Laws and Statutes of this Realm
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch Oaths to be tendered by Eccleſiaſtical Judges; and
therefore the oath of the party, in ſome matter of crime that might be
damageable and penal to him, was both in practice, and was allowed alſo to be
practiſed (in Courts Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical) by the Laws of this Land.</p>

            <p>IN the Chancery, when the proceeding is moved <hi>civiliter,</hi>
and not <hi>criminaliter,</hi> not to any publick puniſhment, but to the
private Intereſt of the party, and ſometimes lewd pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes and
miſdemeanours criminal be in the Bill ſet forth; yet muſt the Defendant
make particular anſwer thereto upon his oath. So in the Court of Requeſts,
in the <hi>Marches of Wales</hi> the Court of the Council there, and in the
North parts; ſo that to the intent of a Defendants being urged by oath
(ſomtimes) to diſcover himſelf in a matter criminal, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to as
much in theſe Courts, as is challenged for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Courts
Eccleſiaſtical: and the Chancery muſt needs be the ancienteſt court of
this Realm, becauſe from thence all original Writs and commiſſions do
come, whereupon the other courts do ground all their proceedings; therefore
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, as in ſundry other points of proceeding there, they drew the
exacting of the Defendants anſwer upon oath from the Civil Law: For that
court of Chancery being here in time and nature the firſt, (after the
<hi>Roman</hi> yoke, before the coming in of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was ſhaked
off here) it could not take light from other courts of the common Law, but from
ſome other, that was before both it and them. The <hi>Romans,</hi> under whom
we were then, gave us theſe Laws moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; ſo they uſed, as their
Hiſtories teſtifie, to moſt Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they ſubdued. Many of the ſame
Laws were taken up and retained by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> eſpecially untill the

            <p>Dr. <hi>Coſens,</hi> chap. 3. in the third part of his Apology,
writes thus: <hi>The grand Jury</hi> (as I take it) <hi>have their oath given
to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and preſent, their own, their fellows, and others faults.</hi>
And Part 3. chap. 14. he ſayes, that at Aſſizes and Seſſions Grand
Juries <hi>are urged by oath to enquire and preſent Treaſons, Murthers, and
other Felonies, breach of the Peace, violation of ſundry Laws and Statutes,
common Nuſances, &amp;c. Now if one of the Grand Jury, being to be ſworn,
would deny to take the Oath, except he might have ſome certain offences
(uſually given in charge) left out and forepriſed ſeverally out of his
Oath, leſt otherwiſe he ſhould thereby be driven to accuſe himſelf:

upon a murther committed, ſhould deſire to be spared from telling his

thereby he be driven to accuſe himſelf: would the Judges ſpare them, and
not rather repute them to be guilty of theſe crimes, for which they refuſe
to take oath and diſcover their knowledge? And why not then, other men
ſhould not, upon crimes nothing ſo penal, who refuſe to take the oath to
anſwer them, be judged by any man to do it upon good ground and
conſcience?</p>

Now, if upon ſuch weighty reaſons, it be moſt needful that Juſtice be

but are by fame, or by ſuch wayes as is aforeſaid, ſo far diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
if there be (as very often there is not) no other way to diſcover them, that
ſo the evil and the ſcandal may be taken away, but by putting the party to
his oath, thereby to clear himſelf, if further due proof thereof cannot be
made, or by refuſal of the oath to be taken <hi>pro confeſſo:</hi> then
it follows, the evil and ſcandal muſt ſtill remain, and all the ſad
effects thereof to Church and State may be expected to follow.</p>
            <p>Be the fame of a crime, Adultery or the like, never ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that Town and countrey, even the Kingdom ring of it: though an Adulterer and
Adultereſſe have cohabited together a long time, yet if they were not taken
or ſeen <hi>in flagranti cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> or ſeen in bed together, which is a
violent preſumption, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52848:33"/>equivalent to a proof; and the
parties deny the fact: ſome make it diſputable, whether or no any manner of
puniſhment (the fact being neither proved nor confeſſed) can be laid
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the parties for this great ſcandal to the Church.</p>
            <p>Some hold, that by the words of this late Act, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
party, upon whom a fame is unjuſtly raiſed, and the beginning of it cannot
be found, as often hath happened, yet though he offer to purge himſelf, the
Eccleſiaſtical Judge is not to tender or adminiſter the oath to him;
though this ſeems otherwiſe, becauſe the oath is forbidden but onely in
ſuch caſes, <hi>whereby the perſon to whom the ſame is tendered or
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, may be charged or compelled to confeſs or accuſe, or to
purge him or her ſelf, of any criminal matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe
may be lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment.</hi> But in this caſe of

ceaſeth.</p>

            <p>Such courſe by way of oath to find out the ſin being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
how great an encouragement it may prove to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch ſins, is obvious to
the eaſieſt judgment. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to make Adultery puniſhable by
death, though that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme be to be avoided, the contrary too muſt be
ſhunned.</p>
            <p>If it be lawful at common Law, as in a Wager at Law, and many other
caſes, as before touched, to tender and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuch oaths, and in
ſuch cauſes as need it not ſo much, as theſe cauſes ordinarily do;
wherein before that late Act it was adminiſtred in Eccleſiaſtical courts:
then why not in Eccleſiaſtical courts? Except it be ſaid, that the ſame
courſe ſhall be taken to forbid it alſo at common Law, which, I
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is not intended; ſince Jury men, as Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> (as
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in that his Apology affirms, had an oath given them to <hi>preſent
their own and their fellows faults.</hi> Now ſuch in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
proceedings.</p>
            <p>The inequality of the puniſhment as to the difference of Sex.
Indeed the permiſſion of puniſhment as to one Sex, the Man, and the
puniſhment to the weaker Sex, the Woman, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52848:33"/>who therefore
deſerves more commiſeration: that inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſay, cannot at beſt
but ſeem ſtrange. For the man will alwayes probably (except either by Gods
grace he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, by confeſſing his fault; or elſe, as before,
be taken <hi>in flagranti crimine;</hi> or with ſuch violent preſumption as
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) eſcape puniſhment though never ſo guilty: It is <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
concatenatum,</hi> there muſt be two to act it. In that ſin the man without
the woman, or the woman without the man, ſignifie no more then the letter
<hi>q</hi> without an <hi>u</hi> following it, to make it into to a ſyllable.
As for the man, his crime is <hi>tranſiens,</hi> leaves no
<hi>veſtigia</hi> behind it to diſcover him: not ſo oftentimes in the
woman, the infallible <hi>indiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens</hi> appearing to every eye, though ſhe is no more guilty thereof
then the man: whom if ſhe rightly name or accuſe, yet that works nothing
againſt him, except to keep the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard child as the reputed father
thereof; wherein not a few light women probably name not the right father; ſo
her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle teſtimony ſerves to puniſh either the right or wrong
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not to take away the ſcandal or evil cauſed by the man that
offended. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation hath been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very friendly and
favourable to the weaker Sex, and very many are the privileges and honoraries
we give them more then in other Nations; for which in the opinion of generous
minds we are accounted more honourable then others; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome have
ſaid, <hi>If there were a bridge 'twixt</hi> Dover <hi>and</hi> Callis,
<hi>all the women in the Continent would come into our Iſland.</hi> But by
this we may ſeem to hazard that honour.</p>
            <p>In Simony, Uſury, and many other crimes of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cogniſance, be the fame, circumſtances, ſuſpicions, and all other
inducements never ſo ſtrong; yet this Oath being not to be adminiſtred,
the offender ſcapes, neither the evil nor ſcandal is removed.</p>
            <p>Biſhops by the Statute 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. are to give the Oaths
of Allegeance and Supremacy <hi>ex officio</hi> to others, or whether it be
<hi>ex officio</hi> or <hi>ad inſtantiam partis,</hi> the matter is all one;
'tis forbidden to give it to any perſon, whereby he may <hi>be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or
compelled to confeſs,</hi> or accuſe, or to purge him or her ſelf of any
criminal <hi>matter or thing, whereby he or ſhe may be <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52848:34"/>lyable to any cenſure or puniſhment.</hi> The refuſal of this
oath is penal, and perhaps the perſon was ſo accuſed to the Biſhop, or
there was a common fame thereof, or other ſufficient inducement to enquire
thereof; if the party refuſe to take this oath thus tendered to him, then is
he by the Law lyable to <hi>Cenſure and puniſhment</hi> for it: and I
conceive it is not thought fit, that ſuch a perſon, be he a Recuſant of
what kind ſoever, ſhould plead this Statute, that this Oath ſhould not be
tendered to them.</p>
            <p>By the Law all Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Judges, when they
give Inſtitution into Benefices, or give licenſe to preach, teach ſchool,
ſerve Cures, and in other caſes, are to give to the parties the Oath of
Allegeance and Supremacy: ſhould theſe parties refuſe to take theſe
oaths, it were penal to them.</p>
            <p>When the Biſhops make their Chancellors, Commiſſaries,
Advocates, Regiſters, Proctors, or the Deans and Chapters, their
Commiſſaries, Officials, or <hi>Auditores cauſarum,</hi> or the
Archdeacons their Officials, or any other Eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
whatſoever, the ſame oaths are to be given them: ſhould theſe parties
refuſe to take theſe oaths, it were penal to them. So a greater part of the
courſe of proceeding in Eccleſiaſtical Courts is taken away, then perhaps
many think of.</p>
            <p>So in the Oath of Calumny and of Malice, to be tendered in the
proceedings in Eccleſiaſtical Courts; if the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take them,
'tis penal to him. And in many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eaſie to be enumerated, but
this may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The guiltleſs and innocent have no benefit by taking away this
oath, eſpecially that of Purgation; nay, (admitting that which, as above,
ſome affirm, That though they offer to take the oath of Purgation, the
Eccleſiaſtical Judge is not to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it) in that caſe they are
endamaged by it, and cannot make their innocency appear in ſuch a way and
means as the Law did afford, and to be reſtored to all intents and purpoſes
to their good name and fame, of which they were in a great part (though
unjuſtly) bereaved; and might have a good Action againſt any, that after
ſuch Purgation defamed them,</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52848:34"/>
            <p>The guilty hereby eſcapes puniſhment, which he may in ſome
ſort <hi>lucri loco reponere,</hi> if it may not be ſaid of him as

            <p>Many other inconveniences and hurts, that too probably may be feared
to ariſe from the prohibition of theſe oaths, in ſuch caſes as before,
might upon further conſideration be enumerated: and though in the laſt
place, yet even that too, of adding further diſcouragement to the
profeſſors of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, who have not had a
few for a long time together, may perhaps deſerve to be thought upon. It is
too viſible that there are not a few, that would not have them enjoy ſo
much of practice and power, as that without which the State can ſcarce
ſpare them, that is in maritime cauſes touching Traffick and Commerce with
Forreigners; a point eminently conſiderable as to the benefit of this
Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Law it ſelf, ſurely all Scholers and ingenuous men, of
what Robe or Profeſſion ſoever, cannot but honour it for the Antiquity,
and in a ſort Univerſality, and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, and the great number of
Nations, and ſo many, and <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52848:35"/>noble, and well-civilized
exerciſe, that were anciently, and in great part, and yet are governed by the

Municipal Laws of our Nation have flowed from that Fountain, and drawn many
Rules and Maxims thence. So that it may, as that learned Civilian, Sir <hi>Rob.
Wiſeman</hi> Knight, Doctor of the Laws, His Majeſties Advocate general for
the Kingdom of <hi>Engl.</hi> in that Treatiſe of his of the Excellency of
the Civil Law, be truly ſtyled <hi>The Law of Laws;</hi> and as it was ſaid
to that <hi>Roman</hi> orator highly commending Eloquence, that he lifted her
up to the skies, that he alſo with her might be raiſed up thither; ſo he
in that learned and judicious Tract of his, ſetting forth the due and juſt
honour and <hi>Encomium</hi> of the Civil Laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be thereby
perpetually honoured. And for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Civil Law in this
Nation, their ſhare of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in theſe late tempeſtuous times was
the earlieſt, began firſt, ſome years before the Loyal Clergy were
deſtroyed: For upon the paſſing that Act for the taking away the High
Commiſſion, in the tail of it was that ſting, which (as the then more
powerful part interpreted it) took away the coercive power from the
Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and ſo in a manner made them uſeleſs and
precarious, if not ridiculous; and within a very few dayes after paſſed
that Act for Poll-money, where every Eccleſiaſtical Judge, that had any
Eccleſiaſtical Office of Judicature, (though ſome of thoſe places were
not worth 30 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> nor 20 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and ſome
leſs) paid 15. <hi>l.</hi> a greater ſumme then ſome men paid of 10000
<hi>l. per annum,</hi> and more in Land of Inheritance: So ſharp-ſighted
was that Act towards that then in a manner even ruined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The
reaſon of it was viſible enough, and no wayes diſhonourable to that
profeſſion or profeſſors, who acted <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52848:35"/>juſtly
according to the known Laws of the Land; had they done otherwiſe, ſurely
they had not wanted legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the times then were, and the cry
that was then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly raiſed againſt them; when the furious flame of
Civil war broke forth, that waſted the Church, all loyal Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all
that had dependance or relation to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of any Offices or Places,
as moſt, if not all, Civilians had then. As to the Civilians, <hi>Sublatum
fuit queſtionis ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> their Offices and Places were quite taken
away. Indeed the moſt reverend Fathers the Lords Archbiſhops and
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with Deans, Chapters, Archdeacons, and other Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries in
Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, taſted of the ſame cup, were <hi>A la
mode</hi> then, but not ſo ſoon as the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, root and branch
deſtroyed: but the Beneficed Rectors and Vicars that for their Loyalty were
thruſt out of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, had a ſmall pittance reſerved them,
(though when paid at all, miſerably ſhrunk and leſſened almoſt to
nothing) that is, as they called it, the Fifths of their Livings: But as to the
reverend Prelates and Dignitaries, and the Civilians, there was nothing left,
under ſuch pitiful Step-fathers, were the then nick-named Fathers of their
Country, the prevailing party in that Long Parliament, during the time of the
long continued uſurping Power, even till His Sacred Majeſties happy
Reſtauration; thoſe cauſes and buſineſſes, which of right ought to
have been agitated and diſpatched by Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their ſeveral Offices
and places, many of them, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Defamation, Matrimonial cauſes,
Tithes, if not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies alſo, and ſeveral other branches of
Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, were all along diſpatched at Common Law
or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, contrary to all Law and equity; Probate of Wills, and granting of
Letters of Adminiſtration, with all the connexes and incidents thereunto
belonging, and from thence ariſing; were by Commiſſion from that
uſurping Power, committed to a few perſons of their own gang at
<hi>London,</hi> ſo that the Subjects from all parts of the Kingdom were to
prove the Wills of the dead, and take Adminiſtration of Inteſtates Goods,
paſſe their Accompts, and act the reſt concerning them, there before them
at <hi>London.</hi> The Executors and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52848:36"/>muſt either come up thither perſonally to them, to take their
oaths, or elſe have Commiſſions down into their Countries to do it; and
the charges to the Subject for ſuch Probate of Wills, Letters of
Adminiſtration, and the reſt, whether they went up themſelves to
<hi>London</hi> to diſpatch them, or more eſpecially if they ſent up by
others thither to have them done, as moſt commonly they did, and not ſcare
one in forty did otherwiſe, and it was the cheapeſt way probably for them
ſo to do, in regard of the charges, to ſend up by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that alſo had
other buſineſs of their own there: Yet, I ſay, by theſe means, and the
great Fees taken, the charges for proving every Will, taking Letters of
Adminiſtration, and the reſt, came ordinarily to about ſix times
(ſometimes much more) as much as was taken and due before theſe
trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom irregular times, by the Eccleſiaſtical Judges and Officers to
whom of right they appertained: that is, the Fees and charges uſually came to
50 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>l.</hi> or 4 <hi>l.</hi> or 5 <hi>l.</hi> and
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to 6 <hi>l.</hi> or more. Had ſuch a Grievance, and ſo general
throughout the Kingdom, reigned in the time of Kingſhip, when faithful and
peaceable men acted according to the known Laws of the Land; ſurely the fall
of <hi>Nilus</hi> to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dupes</hi> would not have made ſuch a
noiſe, as our factious Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would have then bellowed out. And too much
of the grievance ſtill remains, ſuch Wills, Inventories, Bonds ſo
Adminiſtration, with the dependancies thereupon, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill at
<hi>London,</hi> whether the Subject, when they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſee or
uſe any of them, or ſue for any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, muſt either
perſonally repair or ſend for them, or ſue there: which is well hoped
will by this happy Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be remedied, and a courſe taken that they may
be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into every County whence they came, for the Subjects eaſe,
and that they there may ſue upon occaſion, for any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy or other matter
concerning them. Should it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at whoſe charge this ſhould be
done; the dictate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I humbly conceive, anſwers it; <hi>Qui
commodum habet, idem &amp; onus habere debet.</hi> And thus for no ſmall
number of years our Places, our Livelyhoods, were unjuſtly taken from us,
onely for our Loyalty; whileſt others, that did it, gloried 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52848:36"/>in their ſhame, took our bread out of our mouths, and did
eat whileſt we faſted and well nigh ſtarved; and yet ſuch is the
unſatiableneſſe and unreaſonableneſſe of ſome of our
cauſeleſſe perſecutors, that they could well be content we ſhould
ſtill continue in the ſame oppreſſed and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And
when His Majeſty was happily reſtored, (for which all thanks, praiſe and
glory be ever rendred to the God of miracles and mercy) the Civilians, as they
were (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touched) the firſt and earlieſt ſufferers, ſo were
the laſt (not a ſmall time after the moſt reverend Biſhops, and
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the reſt of the Loyal Clergy were reſtored) that were
re-admitted to their places and Offices; and when that was done, ſtill for a
conſiderable time they were but preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and of little uſe or value as
before, till the doubt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching coercive power was by Parliament taken away,
which was not till the later end of Summer 1661. and then with the
<hi>Proviſo</hi> againſt the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation, which
not a little diminiſhes theſe Offices, beſides upon reaſons known, the
forbearance of the full execution of ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as yet, ſo far as by
Law they might execute them, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
            <p>Some Civilians, who in contemplation of their natural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of
their Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy, ſerved His Majeſty in his wars
againſt his then rebellious Subjects, thereby loſt all their Fortunes both
real and perſonal, that their enemies could find: and certainly never were
more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous and rigid ſcrutators, or more rapacious Harpies, that would
not let ſcarce any thing paſſe their clutches. 
<q>Non fuit Autolyci tam piceata manus.</q> And ſuch ſuffering
Civilians, both ſo in their Livelyhoods, their <hi>quotidianum,</hi> and
their perſons and liberties very often, humbly hoped when a time of
re-ſettlement ſhould come, that they ſhould have been looked upon as well
as others of the ſame profeſſion, that ſate ſtill, underwent none of
theſe dangers or hazards, nor ſuffered perhaps any thing, or but little in
their Eſtates or otherwiſe, eſpecially in compariſon 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52848:37"/>with the others, or as well as others that had ſome
competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by reaſon of practice under the uſurped Powers, as to take and
execute Offices under them of great benefit, and I had almoſt ſaid that
way, if not otherwiſe alſo, immediately act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt His Majeſty and
his Authority, contrary to their natural duty, and Oaths of Allegeance and
Supremacy. To plead before the uſurping powers, even after the end of the
war, it was not, at leaſt for a long time, permitted to thoſe Civilians of
the Kings party, eſpecially thoſe that had ſerved him in his wars here.
For my own part, though I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfie my Conſcience ſo far, as
to plead before any of the uſurped powers, not ſo far to acknowledge their
power, though ſome years before His Majeſties happy reſtauration, I was
both here and in <hi>Ireland</hi> invited and deſired to do it, yet I would
not do it, nor ever did that way or any other give any acknowledgment of their
power, or touch any of their Pitch, more then by a forced acquieſcence, and
ſitting quiet and ſtill when I was conſtrained ſo to do. Yet, I ſay,
I am far from cenſuring any of theſe worthy and learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of
either Robe, that did either <hi>agere</hi> or <hi>defendere</hi> before that
uſurping power, by way of pleading: I would not be miſ-underſtood, as to
be thought ſo much as to think amiſſe of the noble Profeſſion or
Profeſſors at Common Law, both which I love and honour, and do very well
know, and have heard many of them, ſuitable to their Births, Breedings, and
loyal and generous Minds, commiſerate the oppreſſion of the
Profeſſion and Profeſſors of the Civil Law, and wiſh that the
proceedings in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, by the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi>
and Purgation, might continue as it was before that laſt Act that took it
away; even for the juſtice of it, as they conceive, as alſo leſt it might
ſeem, at leaſtwiſe in ſome mens judgments, to ſavour of a kind of
partiality, that theſe Oaths <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation ſhould
continue in proceeding at Common Law, and not in the Spiritual and
Eccleſiaſtical Courts, or Courts Chriſtian, as at Common Law by the Laws
of the Land they are ſtyled; a Title we like well, and ſurely that
Nick-name, ſuitable to ſuch debauched and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſons that
gave it, becauſe in theſe Courts their unclean <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52848:37"/>crimes
were puniſhed, and that did <hi>commovere bilem;</hi> though they were
puniſhed there onely, as before, Medicinally, to acknowledge their crimes, to
aske God and the congregation forgiveneſſe, and to take away the evil and
ſcandal, and not mulcted or corporally puniſhed by impriſonment or
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: I ſay, that Nick-name, ſhould it be given at all to any
court, as it ought not, it would rather lean to ſuch courts as inflict
corporal puniſhments and mulcts upon ſuch criminous perſons, by
Impriſonment, keeping the Baſtard children, whipping, or otherwiſe
corporally puniſhing them. I wiſh and hope, that as both the
profeſſions of both Robes ſit as ſiſters under one Crown, derive from
one and the ſame head, and draw from one and the ſame Fountain; ſo each
knowing their certain bounds and limits of Juriſdiction, (which, if not
clearly and explicitely ſettled, I wiſh and hope will be) may proceed
chriſtianly, charitably and friendly in their ſeveral ſpheres of
activity, without claſhing or the leaſt diſſention, to Gods glory, the
good of this Church and Srate, and the juſt diſtribution of Juſtice, to
the benefit and comfort of all the Subjects in His Majeſties Dominions. Let
us all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that not long ſince there was a generation of men, then too
much in power, that had an equal tooth againſt both the Profeſſions,
would gladly have ſeen the deſtruction of both, and made too great a
progreſſe in it. The noble Profeſſon and Profeſſors of the common
Law, could then expect little more favour then <hi>Polyphemus</hi> promiſed
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> that he ſhould be the laſt that ſhould be
devoured. And probably enough ſome of them ſtirred up ſome of the
leſſe-conſiderable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyers, and ſuch as favoured their ſide
too much, (for in all Profeſſions there is good and bad) to be
iuſtrumental in the abolition of the Civil Law; and when that was done, when
the out-works were taken in, then to have a bout with the Fort it ſelf. They
have ſhewed their Method: No Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, no King. But concord and peace, it is
to be hoped, will duly and indiſſolubly cement theſe two Profeſſions,
if amongſt our ſelves we do not <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> and diſ-joyne the
union. Let us never forget St. <hi>Pauls</hi> good counſel and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>All the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52848:38"/>love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. But if ye bite and devour
one another, take heed ye he not conſumed one of another.</hi> For the
Civilians, if they have many enemies and but few friends, (as was ſaid by
one, that 'tis hoped hath no diſaffection to that profeſſion or
profeſſors of it, but rather in a juſt reſentment of their
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſutable to his birth and noble diſpoſition) if ſo, I
ſay, they may comfort themſelves in this, that they were put to the teſt
in the beginning of the Long Parliament, when their factious Accuſers were
ſufficiently numerous and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and had they been found guilty, they had
not then eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped puniſhment, ſevere and infamous enough. They could not
eaſily have been highlier juſtified then that way, which made it appear to
all the world, that that clamorous party, through the ſides of the Civilians,
intended to ſtrike at and wound their Superiors, and ſo ſerve turns and
ends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe their long-weav'd deſign. If the Civilians do their
parts in their Functions, uprightly and diligently, which their own
conſciences doubtleſſe will prompt them to, and the vigilancy of their
factious Adverſaries over their actions, may ſerve to keep them awake; 'tis
to be hoped they will every way find comfort and encouragement: However that
peace at the laſt, and the continual Feaſt in the interim, will buoy them
up above the greateſt waves of envy or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Good men will be their
friends, though the contrary be their enemies: and one <hi>Cato</hi> is better
then a <hi>Theaire.</hi> And we cannot but be confident, that we ſhall never
have cauſe to ſay, as ſome ſaid in another caſe; <hi>Non nos Resp.
ſed defuit nobis Respublica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have a gracious KING, whom God protect, bleſſe, and prolong
his dayes: 
<q>Et Spes &amp; Ratio ſtudiorum in Caeſare.</q> He, we doubt
not, will, as before him his Royal Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, King

And beſides the general, His Sacred Majeſty hath in particular
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his gracious favour that way, by the addition of honour and
honourary revenue to the Maſters of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, Civilians for the moſt
part: an act that, if poſſibly there can be an addition, adds to the juſt
obligation of duty, ſervice and gratitude which they owe his moſt excellent

favours to that Profeſſion and Profeſſors, and for his mediation and
being inſtrumental (as none, I believe, can ſuppoſe otherwiſe) in the

                        <head>A Manuſcript treating of the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi>
ſaid to be Doctor <hi>Davenants,</hi> late Lord Biſhop of
<hi>Sarisbury.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. THat which the Commons Houſe complained of is,
that the Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſtical proceed <hi>Ex officio,</hi> that
is, (ſay they) without a known Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And that they cauſe men to anſwer upon their
oath, that which they would have is this.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That no man ſhould be dealt with, but an
Accuſer ſhould ſtand forth, and that no Oath ſhould be miniſtred to a
man in his own cauſe.</p>
                        <p>That which your Lordſhips have enjoyned me, is to ſhew
my opinion, whether the courſes complained of be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Word of
God or no.</p>
                        <p>Two parts there are diſtinctly to be ſpoken to, the one
of proceeding without a known Accuſer, the other of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of
Oath.</p>
                        <p>I begin with them generally at large, and after as they
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Eccleſiaſtical proceedings.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The end of all Judgments in all Courts, is to
remove evil. The Heathen man ſayes, <hi>Intereſt reipublicae ut malefics
tollantur:</hi> the health of the civil body conſiſting no leſſe in
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving evil perſons, then doth the natural in purging out evil humours.
And the very ſame is Gods courſe in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; ten ſeveral times
in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> he repeats it, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſic tolletis malum de medio
Iſraëlis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Evil then is to be removed, not onely civil but
Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; ſo doth God take expreſs orders, that corrupt
Religion, contumacy in diſobeying his Prieſt, Incontinency, Defamation,
(matters all of Eccleſiaſtical cogniſance) ſhould be removed,
expreſly terming every one of them <hi>malum in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raële.</hi> And
ſo in the New Teſtament doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of the caſe of
Inceſt; <hi>Vos autem auferetis malum de vobis.</hi> 
                           <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52848:39"/>Theſe then are evils, and Eccleſiaſtical evils, and to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If they muſt be removed they muſt be known; for
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Quod ignorat medicina, non curat.</hi>
Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick both corporal and civil muſt know the peccant humour, before they
can purge it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If know it they muſt, by the parties themſelves
they ſhall never know it. The firſt that ever did treſpaſs, were not
ſo ready to commit ſin, but they were twice as ready to conceal it. And as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith to good purpoſe, <hi>Reliqui omnes congeneres
primo:</hi> All other offenders do as the firſt did, ſeek to keep their
offence from being known. The offences themſelves, ye know, are called
<hi>opera tenebrarum,</hi> and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, that defileth the body as well as
the ſpiritual Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is corruption in the Worſhip of God; either
of them, we know, is <hi>angularis actio,</hi> and kept from knowledge as much
as may be.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Then, if they muſt be known, and will not by the
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves, ſome other means muſt be uſed to bring them to
light; where if there be a party to ſtand up and accuſe, 'tis well, and he
not to be refuſed. But we know, and I refer my ſelf to your Lordſhips,
that it is holden an odious matter to be an Accuſer, and with the better
ſort of men more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Few that be well diſpoſed will be gotten to it,
and even they that will, I refer me to your Lordſhips again, whether
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith not true, that <hi>One evil will not be accuſed but
out of another evil:</hi> that is, grudge or ſpleen to wreak our ſelves
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome party, that we conceive hath wronged us; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the
faintneſs of men to become Accuſers will make that much evil will not be
removed, if this be onely the way to remove it; but God ſaith, <hi>All evil
muſt be removed ſo near as may be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. For that cauſe God hath authorized thoſe that
hold Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial places for the removing of evil, not onely to receive
accuſations when they be brought againſt it, but if none be brought to make
enquiry after it, in the 13, 17, and 18 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that by
enquiry it may be found, and found it may be removed: Which Enquiry is not left
at large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52848:40"/>hand over head, but hath his
limitation upon what ground to proceed. Now, if you aske what ground we can
have, no better rule for it, then if we follow Gods own proceeding in his
judicial courſes; for the judgment is Gods properly, and not Mans; and there
is nothing more to be deſired, then that <hi>God would give the King his
judgments;</hi> for the judgments of all thoſe that be in place, are then
beſt when they are likeſt Gods: the rather for that God, needing not to
hold any courſe of Enquiry, becauſe to him all things are clear and
manifeſt, not onely then but before they be done, and yet binding himſelf
to a certain way in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, no other reaſon is or can be rendred,
why he ſhould ſo do, but onely to inſtruct us how to proceed by his
exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In Gods court, true it is, there is an accuſer allowed, even the
accuſer of us and our brethren, who (we ſee) is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard and
received, though his ſuggeſtions be untrue; as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe. But
is there no proceeding but upon accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? I take it to be very clear, that
it will fall out, divers judgments of his having been given upon another
ground.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Adams</hi> caſe no accuſer ſtood forth, what
was done was as yet not known, onely he was taken in ſuſpicious manner,
flying from God, lurking in a Thicket; which was plainly <hi>species mali,</hi>
and God thought it meet to be enquired on: and ſo may we upon like
ſuſpicion, though there be no accuſer, even by his Warrant.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Eves</hi> caſe neither had ſhe any accuſer, but
by examining <hi>Adam</hi> ſhe came to be impeached <hi>tanquam particeps
criminis,</hi> at the leaſt; which, as we know, was by way of detection,
which is not properly accuſation, yet ſufficient enough to ground a
ſentence upon, as (we ſee) God did, and they that ſit in his place may do
the like.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Cains</hi> caſe it fell out clear otherwiſe then
in <hi>Adams,</hi> for in <hi>Adams</hi> the fact was unknown, in
<hi>Cains</hi> onely the party, for the murther was evident.</p>
                        <p>Now to find out the party, the way which God taketh is by
preſumption, for that there had been malice born <hi>Abel</hi> by
<hi>Cain,</hi> and he admoniſhed thereof, his very countenance bewraying as
much; this did God hold cauſe enough to <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52848:40"/>ground an Enquiry
upon, and ſo may we. In the caſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> there is yet another
way; <hi>clamor multus eſt,</hi> ſaith God, there is a great rumour or fame
runneth upon <hi>Sodoms</hi> naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>I will go down and enquire of
it,</hi> ſaith God in expreſs words. So that whether there be accuſation
or no, vehement ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or detection, or ſtrong preſumption, or
fame will ſupply the want of an Accuſer; and the Judge even by very duty is
authorized to proceed to enquire upon any of theſe.</p>
                        <p>A little to inſiſt on this of fame, whereof our Saviour
Chriſt in the Goſpel hath made that a branch which we call <hi>denunciatio
Evangelica;</hi> when a party of good credit diſcloſeth unto the Judge a
fault, but will not ſuſtain either the hazard, trouble or charge of an
Accuſer. Yet doth our Saviour Chriſt give warrant to the Church, even in
that caſe to call the party, and take order with him. But this point of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon fame, hath not onely warrant of proceeding in Gods example,
but in his expreſs charge; two ſeveral places of the Law where the ground
is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.4. <hi>If it be told thee that
ſuch or ſuch a fault is done,</hi> the proceeding is <hi>perſcrutando
&amp; interrogando. Perſcrutando,</hi> that is, by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evidence;
<hi>Interrogando,</hi> that is, by interrogating the party about the fault
ſuggeſted. And we ſee plainly in a caſe of Eccleſiaſtical
correction for matter of Inceſt, the Apoſtle goeth no further, but layeth
this for his ground, <hi>There goeth a report, that ſuch a party there is
among you.</hi> As therefore when an accuſer offereth himſelf, he is not to
be rejected; ſo though none do, rather then faults ſhould go
uncenſurable, the Judge even of very duty is to ſearch them out: In his
ſearch not proceeding without ſome of theſe that have been mentioned, but
with theſe he hath good warrant, even as good as Gods own example and
commandment.</p>
                        <p>Sufficient hath been ſaid to ſhew, that without an
Accuſer a Judge may proceed by enquiry to interrogate a party, but whether
upon his <hi>Oath,</hi> that is the ſecond point to be ſhewed, no leſs
warrantable by the Word of God then the former.</p>
                        <p>In the caſe of the Woman ſuſpected to have made a
fault to her husband, and that upon no other ground, but upon her husbands own
jealouſie; the Eccleſiaſtical Judge was not <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52848:41"/>onely
authorized to examine her concerning it, and then to reſt on her denyal; but
alſo to put her to her oath, and make her to abjure it with execration, as it
is plainly, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. And it is a caſe of a ſin againſt the
ſeventh Commandment.</p>
                        <p>In a ſin againſt the eighth Commandment, betwixt man and
man: <hi>If one had committed ought to anothers truſt,</hi> and were
perſwaded that he had played falſe with him, he might bring him before the
Judge, and have the matter ſearched into, and at the Plaintiffs inſtance
the Judge was to lay an oath upon him, and the other not to refuſe it. And of
this there are more caſes then one, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. And if in private
cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man this manner of proceeding be allowed, it will
follow <hi>à fortiori,</hi> if for the private benefit, much more that
which God granteth to a private man, it is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he will not deny
to a Magiſtrate: that which to ſatisfie one party he licenſeth, he will
likewiſe think meet to licenſe for the taking away of offence, and giving
ſatisfaction unto many. And the chaſtity of a mans Wife ſhall never be
more precious to him, then the keeping of his own Spouſe the Church, free
from the like ſtains of pollution.</p>
                        <p>In a ſin againſt the ſixth Commandment, a caſe of
Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one is found ſlain; no man can be accuſed or ſuſpected for
doing it: In this caſe the Governors of the next City to the body ſo found,
are by the Law to come to the place to offer a ſacrifice, to invocate the
name of God, and ſolemnly to teſtifie by that Invocation, that they are no
waye; privy to the murther. This is the courſe in the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> but before ever the Law was written, we ſee the very ſame
hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>Joſeph</hi> under the Law of Nature. In a matter of State, in
a ſuſpicion of a ſin againſt the fifth Commandment: It pleaſed him to
charge his ten Brethren as Spies coming to diſcover the weakneſs of the
Land; there was no party to accuſe or to ſay ought againſt them, yet for
all that he put them to it <hi>ſub atteſtatione juramenti,</hi> to
anſwer, They were no ſuch men.</p>
                        <p>The very like courſe was holden in the ſearch for
<hi>Elias;</hi> he was thought to be the cauſe of the long and great drought:
The King ſent all over the Land to ſeek for him, and to have 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52848:41"/>him apprehended; theſe eſpecially that were thought to
be the Profeſſors of the ſame Religion, all denyed him; it would not
ſerve the turn, he put them to their oaths, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them not, yet
was there none to accuſe them at all. Yet for the good (as it was
ſuppoſed) of the State, this courſe was well allowed.</p>
                        <p>So have we Interrogatories adminiſtred, and the parties
ſworn to them, in caſes of the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                        <p>And if this may be done in civil cauſes, and be not
unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in them, we argue that much rather it ought to be allowed the Church
in her proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for that both Commonwealth and Church be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
evil, yet work they not both one way; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as it is well
known, doth <hi>agere ad poenam;</hi> the Church never ſo, but doth onely
<hi>agere ad poenitentiam,</hi> ſeeketh to alter mens minds, from the evil
courſes they have entered into, ſeeketh by making them to yield to a
voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion rhemſelves, to take away the ſcandal, whereof
they have been a cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Now there is great odds between thoſe, and great reaſon
more means be allowed thoſe, that ſeek for nothing elſe, but the
reformation of the party and his ſouls health; and thoſe that end their
proceedings alwayes in the loſs of life, limb or liberty, or living, as doth
the Civil.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, it is well known the civil power hath many wayes
and means to ſift out the truth, though not by this, That the Church (if
Accuſations ceaſe) hath none, but this onely. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed therefore moſt
proper and peculiar to her, becauſe an oath is the bond of the Soul, and they
be the ſole cauſes the Church hath to deal with.</p>
                        <p>The inconvenience is none at all: for admit a party ſhould
thereby diſcloſe his offence, yet groweth thereby no damage unto him, in
that his repentance onely and reformation is thereby ſought, and wrought, and
nothing elſe.</p>
                        <p>Thus reaſons the Church, but for her practice taketh her
ground to be full and good out of the fifth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> in a caſe of
ſuſpected Incontinency, which is meerly Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52848:42"/>And again, out of 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.
in a caſe Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, which is meerly Eccleſiaſtical alſo. In both
which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories are miniſtred with oath, the proceeding being by
Enquiry, without any Accuſer at all. And that which is to be noted in the
caſe in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> they are no wayes forced to it, but deſire to
take their oath firſt, and be examined after. Then which there is no caſe
more like to the proceeding at this day, againſt which exception is
taken.</p>
                        <p>Out of theſe ſix it is manifeſt enough how agreeable
to the Will of God this proceeding is: But beyond all this is the ſeventh in
the fifth of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> where it appeareth that God is ſo careful to
have all evil removed, as leave is given by him upon a fault committed, the
party being unknown, to lay a ſolemn charge, and to bind it with a curſe,
and that at large, to take hold of any that were privy to the fault done, and
did not come and reveal it.</p>
                        <p>Which courſe was clearly of the nature of an Oath, as doth
plainly appear by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. where it is ſaid four ſeveral times,
that <hi>Saul</hi> bound all the people with an oath, not to taſte of any
thing till the Sun went down, that they might purſue their enemies without
any intermiſſion: Which oath is judged by the Expoſitors to have been
nothing elſe but the publick denouncing of a curſe, or adjuring them in the
name of God not to do it, ſeeing it is held a thing impoſſible, that he
ſhould call ſo many thouſands in particular, to take every man an oath,
the time being ſo ſhort, and he in ſuch haſte to purſue the Enemy.
But it is a thing, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, not unuſual, either before
Chriſt or ſince, in the time of the Primitive Church, to make ſuch
adjurations, whereby the Church ever thought, <hi>quod poena commiſſi
revolvitur in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcium,</hi> that he that concealed was ſubject to as
great a curſe as he that committed it.</p>
                        <p>By all which it is evident, that ſuch proceeding by oath
may be, and is not unlawful.</p>

                        <p>And firſt of all, it is a ſacred right that ſuch an
oath may be lawfully required: In which matter I think it is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveful
(as Chriſt did in the caſe of Divorcement) firſt of all to enquire what
every thing was in the beginning: in the revolution of time many things are
changed, the beginning is the moſt certain rule. Therefore I aske where and
when the firſt mention of an oath is made in Scriptures? I finde
<hi>Gea.</hi> 24. <hi>Abraham</hi> forcing his ſervant to take an oath, in
theſe words, and with this ceremony; <hi>Put thy hand under my Thigh, and I
will make thee ſwear, that thou ſhalt take a wife for my ſon, of my
Kindred.</hi> So the firſt oath mentioned in Scripture, is here
expreſſed: and as it is the moſt ancient and firſt, ſo it is the
moſt frequent and onely mention almoſt of ſuch a thing. This very term
(to <hi>Swear</hi>) you will ſcarce any where find it in the Old Teſtament,
but either under the word <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phil,</hi> that is the Imperative, commanding
conjugation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of him that gives the oath: or under the word
<hi>Niphal,</hi> that is the paſſive ſuffering conjugation, in reſpect
of him that takes the oath. And under the ſame rule are the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom <hi>Orcos</hi> is the name of the oath, which almoſt ſolely
the holy Ghoſt acknowledges in the New Teſtament. In that word is a kind of
ſtraitning neceſſity, and as they ſay, an exigengy no leſs then there
is in the word <hi>Orcos;</hi> for from the ſame word comes both, that is of
<hi>ſtraitning.</hi> Thereupon comes that common Proverb, <hi>War and Oaths
are voluntary evils;</hi> and that they may be good, they ought to be
<hi>preſſed and expreſſed</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of Oaths
ſayes wittily) <hi>either by the Authority of him that gives the oath, or at
leaſtwiſe by the hardneſs of his heart that believes nor</hi> So that it
is a ſin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſwear or to make war, except it be at leaſt in ſome
manner exacted, and upon ſome and no light cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it may be
required, or rather that it ought to be, the very force of Nature, the very
force of the term it ſelf evinceth it,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52848:43"/>But whether from the Magiſtrate? (this
is the ſecond branch.) Yes ſurely from the Magiſtrate.</p>
                        <p>So the Divines of old; <hi>Not onely every body but every
ſoul is to be ſubject to the Powers, Rom.</hi> 13.1. Therefore the Powers
have power to commit the body to cuſtody, by impriſoning it, leſt it
eſcape: And ſo likewiſe the ſoul, to commit that to cuſtody, by
laying an oath upon it, leſt it ſhould have any ſubterfuge, by which name
God himſelf hath moſt fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Oath, the <hi>Bond or priſon of
the ſoul, Num.</hi> 30.13. by which the ſoul may as it were be tyed up; and
being ſo tyed up, may be bound to anſwer appoſitely and readily. But yet
it comes nearer: If it be lawful for the Maſter to force his ſervant to
take an oath, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Abraham</hi> did; if a father to his
ſon, as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 47.29. if a brother to a
brother, as the ſame <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſan, Gen.</hi> 25.33. By how
much better right is it lawful for the Magiſtrate to do it to his Subject,
whoſe command is more excellent then any other command? I adde alſo about
the right ſettling in marriage of a ſon, if that be lawful, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> to his ſervant; of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a fitting place of burial, as
to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> of paſſing away the right to Birth-right, as
<hi>Eſau;</hi> and in private cauſes, I adde alſo of the leaſt
concernment, if compared with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: Then ſurely by better right may
the Magiſtrate do it, in the common cauſe of the Commonwealth, whoſe
Intereſt is greater then any other Intereſt. And that is provided for by
Gods Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. in expreſs terms; in the caſe of a Pawn,
ſaith God, <hi>let them come before the Magiſtrate:</hi> In which place the
Magiſtrates are named by the name of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not by any name, but
by that very name which is taken from the force of an oath: as though he
ſhould ſay, Let them come before the Oath-givers, or thoſe who (when they
give the Law in Gods ſtead) in his Judgment and in his Name may require his
Oath to be taken: That is, Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. in Gods
judgment: 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.8. the Oath of God: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.2.
therefore to the Magiſtrate. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Magiſtrate, I ſay, as
well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil. Before him that is the Eccleſiaſtical
Judge by Law, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is commanded to purge her ſelf in a caſe of
ſuſpicion of <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52848:44"/>breach of Wedlock bond, <hi>Num.</hi>
5.19. Before him that is the Temporal Judge by Law, the man is commanded to
purge himſelf in a cauſe of ſuſpicion of breach of Social promiſe or
Contract, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. The practice whereof we ſee (and the
<hi>practice of the Saints is the Interpreter of the Commandments</hi>) of the
Eccleſiaſtical Judge in <hi>Ezra,</hi> who required an oath in a
Matrimonial cauſe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.5. Of the Temporal Judge in
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who forced an Oath in a cauſe of Uſury, <hi>Neh.</hi>
5.12. Neither hath the pious and religious Magiſtrate onely right to do this,
but the Heathen Magiſtrate too, and that to Gods people; <hi>Zedckiah</hi>
gave his Oath of Allegeance to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
36.9. though forced he gave it, and rightly too, if we believe
<hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and afterwards by a ſacrilegious boldneſs he attempted to
break it, he ſcaped not unpuniſhed for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.13. Laſtly,
I adde that this was not lawful to do to their own people onely, but alſo to
gueſts and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, living within thrir Territories, either for
trafficking or any other cauſe: In which regard <hi>Joſeph,</hi> now become
Vice-Roy of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> impoſes an Oath upon his Brethren in a caſe of
Treaſon ſuſpected, though both by Law and by Nature they were
<hi>Canaanites, Gen.</hi> 43.3. therefore hence it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that it is
lawful to impoſe an Oath, and that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo to the
Magiſtrate.</p>
                        <p>But whether is it lawful to do it to the party, that is, the
party guilty or defendant? (the third thing I propounded.) Nor can that be
called into queſtion, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. He to whom the Pawn was
concredited is the party guilty or defendant, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.19. The woman
ſuſpected by the jealous husband to have wronged his bed, is alſo the
party guilty or defendant: but to each of them is this oath to be given, nor is
it lawful for them to decline it. In a few words I will ſumme it up: Whether
one deceitfully keeps his neighbours goods, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly deteins his
friends goods, or reſtores not to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner his found goods, when he
requires them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.3. or (as it ſeems to me) in any other
crime, (for it is mentioned indefinitely, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.31. in
<hi>whatſoever he ſhall ſin</hi>) it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Plaintiff or
Agent to <hi>impoſe an oath upon the party,</hi> that is the guilty or
defendant, or <hi>to lay an oath upon him,</hi> as <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52848:44"/>it is in
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe; nor is it lawful for the guilty or defendant
party to refuſe it, whether it be impoſed by the Agent or Plaintiff, or by
the Magiſtrate. Indeed I cannot deny, but we are fallen into ſuch times,
that it may be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to impoſe the oath upon the party, Agent or
Plaintiff, and not onely upon the Defendant; for it may happen that they may
both prevaricate, that is, the party Agent or Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff by calumniating, and
the party guilty or defendant by Tergiverſation. But if we would take the Law
from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from the holy Writ, to the party guilty or defendant, 'tis more
neceſſary to be given. Examples are thereof: Scarce will you find in the
Law an oath laid upon the Agent or Plaintiff, but very often may you find it
upon the party guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or defendant: <hi>Moſes</hi> renders the reaſon of
it; The actor (who for the moſt part is the party endamaged) he is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with anger, he is wholly wrapt up in the Leaven of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and revenge, ſtruck
through with the ſting of malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>will be raſh with his
mouth,</hi> which the Wiſeman forbids to be in an oath, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1.
therefore the matter of an Oath herein is altogether unfit. But the party
guilty or defendant, whom the Law alwayes ſuppoſes to be guilty of the
crime charged, till the contrary appear, is much fitter: In him there is leſs
prejudice, leſs of affections, beſides perhaps of fear, which is as it were
the heart of an oath. Therefore it is lawful to lay it upon the party guilty or
defendant, and fitting too to do ſo.</p>
                        <p>Now I come to the fourth branch; In what cauſe this is
fitting: which is more intricate, and hath more queſtion in it. And I ſhall
not ſeek any where elſe for the diviſion of theſe cauſes, but in our
Law, that is, the Law of <hi>Divines:</hi> there in the holy Law ſome are
called wrongs or prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.9. ſome capital cauſes,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21.21. whereof ſome of thoſe being heinous, are puniſhed
with loſs of life, life either by being deprived of natural life, or civil,
that is, Baniſhment, or (as the holy Writ ſpeaks) <hi>rooting out,
Ezra</hi> 7.26. To which are allied <hi>cauſes of bloud,</hi> ſuch as are
<hi>Deut.</hi> 25.12. Lopping off a limb; and there in the ſecond Verſe,
inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtripes: but theſe others were not ſo great, and were 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52848:45"/>partly puniſhed by pecuniary Mulcts, partly by
impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Eſth</hi> 7.26.</p>
                        <p>Was there any place for ſuch an oath to be given, in
ſuch crimes as were puniſhed by loſs of life? truly I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
to that. Firſt, the practice in Scripture contraries it; for I ſee when
<hi>Achans</hi> life was in queſtion, <hi>Joſhua</hi> dealt thus, <hi>Tell
me, my ſon, ſwear not to me.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Saul</hi> in the like
caſe concerning <hi>Jonathan, Tell me Jonathan,</hi> do not ſwear to me: a
willing, not expreſs confeſſion; a ſimple interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not under the
bond of an oath. But (which is the hinge of the queſtion) I ſee the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> himſelf interrogated by the King himſelf, <hi>I will aske
thee a thing, hide nothing from me:</hi> The Prophet covenants with him, <hi>If
I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not ſurely put me to death?</hi> (nor did
<hi>Jeremy</hi> thus cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without the dictate of the holy Ghoſt:) as if
in ſuch cauſes God had given an immunity of anſwering, <hi>Jer.</hi>
38.14. And indeed Reaſon perſwades the ſame; for indeed ſo ought
Inquiſition (as far as it may be) to be made by the Magiſtrate, that the
manifeſt loſs of ſouls may be avoided. When as from the mouth of the
greateſt Liar that moſt true ſentence proceeded, <hi>Skin after skin, and
all that a man hath will he give for his life, Job</hi> 2.4. it is to be feared
that that, <hi>whatſoever, or all that a man hath,</hi> will comprehend as
well the conſcience of an oath, as the fear of God, and what elſe ſoever
comes under the notion of Religion, as men are, and as they are diſpoſed.
Wherefore, though I define nothing (I know not how) in ſuch cauſes as
theſe, in regard of the preſent danger of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet I think 'tis beſt
to forbear the impoſing of an Oath. And the Laws which we uſe (at leaſt
according to leave or permiſſion) judge the ſame. But in other caſes,
being of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer offenſe, and ſo puniſhed more eaſily, I think
otherwiſe: Except perhaps we take that ſentence out of the Comick Poet, and
place it in Divinity; <hi>An Oath is for the keeping of a thing, not for the
loſing of it:</hi> For by that general Law it is provided, <hi>Lev.</hi>
5.4.—<hi>If a ſoul ſwear, pronouncing with his lips, to do evil or to
do good, whatſoever it is that a man ſhall pronounce with an oath, and it
be hid from him when he knoweth of it, then he ſhall be guilty in one of
theſe.</hi> And whereas this cannot be <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52848:45"/>underſtood of
the <hi>Evil of guilt or of a crime</hi> (as we ſpeak in the Schools)
<hi>leſt an Oath, which is a bond of piety, ſhould become a bond of
Iniquity:</hi> it follows, it muſt hold in an <hi>evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
in which kind it is neither lawful to refuſe an oath, nor after it is taken
to break it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to refuſe it. Solomon</hi> wittingly and
prudently laid an oath upon <hi>Shimei,</hi> to the loſs of his liberty,
<hi>that he ſhould not go beyond Cedron;</hi> and he lawfully laid this oath
on him: and when afterwards <hi>Shimei</hi> (having ſworn not to paſs
theſe bounds) yet did it, he loſt his life for it, and juſtly, not onely
for paſſing beyond <hi>Cedron,</hi> but for the violation of his oath, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 2.43. What would you have? even prophane <hi>Shimei</hi>
refuſes not an oath, though to the loſs of his liberty. Nor
<hi>Micheas,</hi> who by the King was bound up under the Religion of an oath,
(neither was that once onely, or that the firſt time, but it had been done
ſometimes before) when he was free, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; but being ſworn, refuſed
not, but anſwered: though his certain puniſhment was before his eyes,
though for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he was to be ſent to priſon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
22.16. By which example it appears, as well that it was then the cuſtom in
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to take an oath to anſwer, as alſo that the Prophet
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas</hi> durſt not (perhaps he was ignorant of Gods Law in that
point) do as we do now-a-dayes, either covenant that the oath ſhall not
entangle us, or endanger our liberty; or if that may not be granted, then to
uſe Tergiverſation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to break the oath.</hi> That is, (as the
principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) if it may lawfully be performed: for except it be ſo,
rightly ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, Juſtice breaks unjuſt bonds.</hi> I
hope the Magiſtrate ſhall not have leſs power then every one of the
vulgar, and every private perſon: every of them have at leaſt that ſmall
power. If he be ſworn to his loſs, yet he muſt not change in that he hath
promiſed to his neighbour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. and if not his promiſe to
his neighbour, then not to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, by a better right ſure, or
equal at leaſt. What then? even prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> revoked not his
oath, though it was to the loſs of his Inheritance. But that private men,
once for all, may know under what Law they are in this caſe, it is not
lawful, no not for a King, to do it: <hi>Zedekiah</hi> took an oath to his
loſs, <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52848:46"/>and as at the firſt view it ſeems, even as well
to his own ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as the ſlavery of his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.13. he
changed: but God both deteſted and revenged that fact of his. Nor is it
lawful for a Commonwealth ſo to change: The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> made a League with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and ſwore to
it, and this was contrary both to their profit and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique command of
God: <hi>Joſhua</hi> (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.15.) though not fit to have it
chang'd, and he thought right: The ſame oath <hi>Saul</hi> afterwards
preſumed to change, though he did it in zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet
that was expiated, firſt, by the danger of the loſs of his Kingdom, and
afterwards by the cutting off his poſterity, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. Therefore
this is not lawful for a King, a Commonwealth, nor a private man to do. Now I
conclude: So be it there be not danger of loſs of life in it, in matters and
cauſes, which are puniſhed either by pecuniary Mulcts, or by
impriſonment, it is lawful for the Subject to undergo that oath, and for the
Magiſtrate to require it. But in this point is much doubting; this Oath, how
far it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and in what manner and caſe? Which whileſt I treat of,
all my action is (as they call it) the purſuing of the Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
by which it may be known at length, in which way we may go where we may go no
further: and hereof I ſee three parts, (as far as concerns our purpoſe)
which are thus deſigned in holy Writ, 1. The admiſſion of the ſuit or
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call it; that is, the entrance of the
cauſe into judgment, out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls
it <hi>receiving an accuſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. The ſecond is
the ſtate and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cauſe, that is, <hi>the foundation of the
ſuit or complaint,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> give it the name out of
<hi>Deut.</hi> 19.13. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call it, <hi>the matter to be judged
and determined.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> (if I be not deceived) ſayes it is
<hi>an end of ſtrife, Heb.</hi> 6.16. The third is, <hi>Inquiſition upon
the proofs,</hi> that is, as the <hi>Jews</hi> call it a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation or
ſifting of the ſuit or complaint, out of <hi>Iob</hi> 29.16. the
<hi>Greeks</hi> call it a Structure of the cauſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it
a <hi>confirmation, Heb.</hi> 6.16. (for with the fourth, which all men call
the Sentence, I have nothing to do.) Therefore theſe three things are to be
in all Judiciary proceedings, <hi>That the party ought to be lawfully
queſtioned;</hi> after that, <hi>the ſtate of the <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52848:46"/>cauſe;</hi> then, <hi>the proofs are to be looked into.</hi> And in
the firſt part there is no uſe of an oath, that I know or have read of: yet
that I ſhould enquire hereof, ſome mens error makes me do it, which error I
ſhall leſſen this day, (if it may be done) who think themſelves not
ſufficiently accuſed, nay they think they ſhall accuſe themſelves,
except an accuſer ſtep forth and ſhew himſelf; and who falſly and
raſhly ſuppoſe, and yet the ſuppoſe it, that that oath which is
required of them for the ſtating of the cauſe, that is the ſecond part,
that is to be required to the firſt part, this is the admiſſion of the
ſuit or complaint.</p>
                        <p>So I propoſe it thus: In every ſuit or complaint the
matter either is ſo apparent, as that it is manifeſt as well concerning the
fact as the perſon: whether the perſon be deprehended in the deed doing,
that is, (as they ſay) taken in the manner, as ſhe was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.4.
Or ſo with an high hand, or (as we uſe to ſay) with a notorious
boldneſs, as attempted before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and all the Congreation, as
was <hi>Zimri's</hi> wickedneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.8. In which caſes ſo
openly acted there was no need of accuſer or witneſs: or if it be ſo,
that the fact is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, but the perſon is unknown; as in the dead body
found, but the murtherer is not known, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.1. or the perſon is
known, but the fact unknown, as in <hi>Achans</hi> caſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi>
7.18. In which matter ſo controverted, a man may, by the judgment of the
Divine Law, be called into queſtion four manner of wayes.</p>
                        <p>For either one may be brought forth upon ſome ſigns
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> preſumptions, as in that
firſt piece of Gods juſtice, (which all humane juſtice imitates) it was
done againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> without an accuſer, onely upon ſigns and
preſumptions, that is, that he fled, and hid himſelf amongſt the Trees,
(a ſign of a guilty mind) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. In the ſecond piece of
juſtice againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> that likewiſe was upon ſigns and
preſumptions, (that is, <hi>Abel</hi> appearing no where) effuſion of bloud
being found, <hi>Cains</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or envy towards <hi>Abel</hi> foregoing it,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6,10. This is the firſt manner.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, Or one may be brought forth upon the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of another, as in that very firſt piece of juſtice; 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52848:47"/>
                           <hi>Adam</hi> onely was cited, but he being queſtioned
(as uſually it happens) impeaches <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe likewiſe the Serpent,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. and ſo they two hereby were made parties guilty or
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</p>
                        <p>The third is, by Fame, or rather Infamy, as for the moſt
part ſuſpicion follows in the neck of the facts of wicked men, talk or fame
follows the ſuſpicion, and inſinuation or complaint follows the talk or
ſame: And thus was the courſe againſt the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 18.20.
<hi>The cry of the Sodomites is great, I will go down now and ſee,
&amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Lord. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner were Inquiſitions
made both in the Law, <hi>If it be told thee, and thou haſt heard it,
Deut.</hi> 17.4 and in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel againſt the inceſtuous perſon, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>It is reported.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth is by Suggeſtion or Complaint, as in
<hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.11. where the Accuſer of our brethren
(as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls him) would have made that holy man guilty of
Hypocriſie, a falſe crime, yet a crime; and that partly
<hi>juridically,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which name amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> they
were called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the ſuit or controverſie, Iſaiah</hi> 50.8.
(we tranſlate it Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.) And here the puniſhment of the offending
party was ſought after, that he might give ſatisfaction to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
wronged; partly (as it is called) Evangelically, wherein one is denounced or
reported to the Church, where onely the medicine or remedy is ſought after,
that the Church may have ſatisfaction in cauſe of ſcandal: In the
firſt, the thing it ſelf (as we uſe to ſay) ſpeaks and impeaches the
party guilty; in the ſecond, one guilty perſon impeaches another; in the
third, the ſpeech of the people is the Accuſer; in the fourth, any one
under the proper and true name of an Accuſer.</p>
                        <p>To this I adde a Fifth, but not (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> theſe) as an ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to determine the
controverſie; but plainly an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary one, not to be put in practice
but in the Valley of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> that is, againſt the troublers of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> (for ſo the word <hi>Achor</hi> ſounds) that is, in
ſome-heinous wickedneſs, or the ſtate of the Church and Kingdom being in
danger: in ſuch caſes we run to extraordinary remedies, that is, to
<hi>Lots</hi> as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> did, which in certain cauſes is not
granted, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.16. In this <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made uſe onely of
his own ſuſpicion, <hi>Are not <pb n="77" facs="tcp:52848:47"/>you Spies?</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>to ſee the nakedneſs of the Land ye are come, Gen</hi> 429. and
when they denyed, yet without ſign or token, fame or any Accuſer, he
queſtioned them, thruſt <hi>Simeon</hi> into priſon, and forced the
reſt to take an oath: Nor did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Law of Nations, or complain
that they were uſed contrary to Law and right. For where the peace of the
Commonwealth is concerned, that is of ſuch moment, that I doubt not, that God
ſuffers his ſpirit of jealouſie to come upon the Magiſtrate, touching
the ſafety of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no leſs then he ſuffers the Husband
to have his, touching the chaſtity of his Wife, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.14. For the
matter in queſtion, it is in a main degree, dangerous, that it ought not to
be diſſembled: and the perſons with whom 'tis acted uſe not to bring in
any witneſſes, (but ſuch as are guilty themſelves) by whom they may be
convinced. And as to the crime we ſpeak of, it is of that kind of
wickedneſſe that leaves no prints, footſteps or marks behind it, by which
they may be taken hold of: Wherefore in thoſe caſes it is no leſſe
lawful to queſtion or accuſe upon ſuſpicion onely, then it is by the
Pillory, Stocks, or

crimes, no man allowes. Well does <hi>Seneca</hi> (if I temember well) render
the reaſon hereof, <hi>Where Villanies run riot beyond meaſure, 'tis
unjuſt that juſtice ſhould be tyed to degrees:</hi> to which that plainly
extraordinary queſtion of him; who about that wicked extraordinary act of
<hi>Achan</hi> betook himſelf to lots, is not very unlike. The God of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> would have them to be troubled, that go about to trouble the
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: and hereof the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> is a
perpetual monument. Now, whomſoever the Magiſtrate calls in queſtion by
any one of theſe four, or if it concern the peace of the Commonwealthy; or of
the Church, the fifth way either) foregoing, the partie is lawfully called. Nor
is there any reaſon he ſhould fear, that he ſhould accuſe or bewray
himſelf, he is now lawfully accuſed and bewrayed. He is, now that he is
accuſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed, to take care how he ſhall lawfully defend himſelf.
And hitherto of the right of Accuſation.</p>
                        <p>Now I aſſume the ſecond. The matter being thus before 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52848:48"/>the Judge brought into doubt, the party guilty or
defendant, either confeſſes the crime committed, as <hi>Achan</hi> did, and
then the Judge hath no more to do but to pronounce ſentence; or (which is
moſt commonly done) denies it: which <hi>Solomon</hi> moſt elegantly
expreſſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.17. <hi>He that is firſt in his own cauſe
ſeemeth juſt, but his neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him.</hi> Now the
party guilty or defendant denying, by repelling the objection, and the Agent or
Plaintiff affirming his intention: thereon ariſes that contradiction St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. the bounder or end of which
contradiction is, that which in every Judicature is ſought for, as there the
Apoſtle obſerves; but no bounder will be found, till the matter be put in
an equal ballance, except the one party have a better <hi>confirmation</hi>
then the other; 'tis the Apoſtles word in the ſame place, therefore 'tis
the Judges part to enquire on which part that lyes. 'Tis but a light labour and
little praiſe to end ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as are eaſie and plain; but
that's the worth of a Judge, to ſift out ſuch cauſes, where the right is
obſcure and perplexed: <hi>The cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched
out,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> of himſelf, <hi>Iob</hi> 29.16. And to do that
dexterouſly and fitly is the honour of a Magiſtrate, ſaith <hi>Solomon,
Prov.</hi> 25.1. to whom himſelf, that ſentence he pronounced, in that
moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult cauſe 'twixt the two Harlots, touching the uncertain mother
of the ſurviving child, was an high honour, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.27. But before
theſe <hi>confirmations,</hi> that is, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the cauſe, ought
to be or can be ſet forth, it is neceſſary ſome ſtate of the cauſe
muſt be ſettled; or as it were a hinge muſt be, on which the cauſe may
be turned, and that firſt of all to be made manifeſt, what and how far he
affirms and the other denies, wherein each of the Litigants may rightly call
the other, to ſet ſoot to foot and hand to hand. Sayes the <hi>Iew,</hi>
and prudently does he ſay it, <hi>Firſt of all place me the comroverſie
upon his foundation;</hi> which except you do, (as very aptly ſome ſpeak
out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.) the whole Action is but meer vanity, toſſed on
this ſide and that ſide, this way and that way, 'twixt the Agent and
Defendant: which as we cannot endure here in the Schools, much leſſe ought
it to be ſuffered in Judicature, whoſe proceeding thoroughout, ought to be
ſolemn and <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52848:48"/>ſacred, and the very Juſtice of Juſtice,
as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.20.</p>
                        <p>This ſubject matter to be judged, or ſtate of the
cauſe, or (if any would rather call it ſo) the bounder of the
controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, is to be ſought out, either in the behalf of the guilty or
defendant party, or of the Agent: Not of the Agent, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he cannot,
becauſe oftentimes there is none ſuch, when one is called into queſtion
upon preſumption, or elſe upon fame; and when there is, he is almoſt rapt
and tranſpoſed, or is driven on, either out of hatred or ſome other
oblique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that he himſelf is unſtated; ſo that from him in vain
is the ſtate of the cauſe required: Wherefore to the party guilty or
defendant is this favour granted, or rather this honor is given, (who is
alwayes a perſon certain, and whom the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts not convicted for
guiltleſſe) that he ſhould either by affirming or denying fix to
himſelf the ſtate of the cauſe; yea, that by his anſwer onely the
ſtate of the whole controverſie may be ſetled, and not onely the ſtate
of the controverſie, but (except he be convinced of falſhood by the
teſtimony of two witneſſes beyond all exception) an end too of the
controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But that he may not, if he be looſe and free, depart from
that ſtate ſo by him ſixed, and afterwards not ſtand to that ſtate,
but ſhall recoil and go back from his purpoſe; a <hi>bond,</hi> a <hi>bond
of the ſoul</hi> (as God gave it the name) he is to enter into, that is, a
religious affirmation, by which his ſoul is as it were bound up with a chain,
to ſpeak out the truth holily and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that is, the truth (not that
abſolutely, but) as he knows it or believes it; nor muſt go contrary to his
conſcience, which we call lying, but even as he were acting with God
himſelf, ſo muſt he act with the Magiſtrate, that is Gods Lieutenant,
that repreſents him, and requires right.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the people of God proceeded thus,
(that is, ſwore to make true anſwer) that practice of <hi>Michaeas</hi> (of
which I made mention above) and that, which is much apter, that other in that
queſtioning of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.10. evince it; where, when
they had expreſly anſwered, <hi>He is not with us,</hi> the King not
herewith contented, forced them to an oath, that they had not found him: as if
no Law could compell a man, to reſt on the anſwer of a man unſworn.
Wherefore as <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52848:49"/>it is altogether fit, that the party guilty or
defendant ſhould be bound up, leſt he might evade or change the ſtate of
the cauſe, and thereupon one ſtate, and then another follows, and indeed
ſo there will be no place of conſiſtency or ſettling the cauſe: So he
ought to be bound up, not with his bare naked anſwer, or (as others would
have it) with a pecuniary Mulct, (theſe are not bonds of the ſoul, which is
the Interpreter of Truth) but with that alone, true and onely bond of the
ſoul, that is, by an <hi>Oath.</hi> And thus at length the whole hinge of the
cauſe being fixed as it ought to be, let us proceed to thoſe Confirmations,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them.</p>
                        <p>Neither is it fitting (as I hear ſome complain) that the
guilty or defendant party ſhould be ſo bound up, and the Agent altogether
free. Nor is our Law ſo: but as it is not ſafe for the party agent to be
ſworn, for the reaſons that I have twice named, 
<note place="margin">Apot. 12.10.</note>(and God himſelf
ſuffers Satan, whom he knows to be a Calumniator, to be alſo an Accuſer)
yet the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation is ſo to be put into ſuit or action, and the
accuſer is ſo by contract to give ſecurity, under the penalty of a
certain pecuniary Mulct, or of a certain note of Infamy, under the price of the
<hi>loſs of his time,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 11.19.</note>(as the Law ſpeaks)
except he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and prove the ſuggeſtion and accuſation he hath
given in: So it is provided for on both ſides; on the one ſide by the
Religion of an Oath, on the other ſide by a double Mulct, and no ſimple
Infamy; ſo that the Agent cannot calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, nor the party guilty or
defendant cannot fly back. Now that firſt of all the guilty or defendant
party ſhould be ſworn, and then anſwer, (which ſome cannot away
withall) it is juſt and lawful; for if he ſhould do it unſworn, he
ſhould do it but in a trifling manner, (that is, being free from the Religion
of an Oath) if any clauſe in the action ſhould more cloſely preſſe
him, he ſhould refuſe to anſwer, ſhould turn himſelf to and fro,
ſeek ſhifts, diverſions and cautels, ſhould anſwer nothing
explicitely and home; that which in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Religiou he is tyed to do,
after he has bound himſelf by oath to do all things holily and clearly, that
he had rather be guilty of doing an injury then of Perjury, and would rather
ſubject himſelf to loſſe then damnation.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:52848:49"/>
                        <p>Shall we take a form hereof from the Law and the holy Writ?
none ſeems to me fitter for that purpoſe, then that queſtioning of
<hi>Ezra,</hi> in the 9. and 10. Chapters of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where the parties
guilty or defendant anſwer, but firſt were ſworn: The order and courſe
of which judicial proceeding was this; ſome of the principal perſons come,
and relate the matter to <hi>Ezra,</hi> of Marriages contracted by many
(ſuppoſe an hundred and ten) with ſtrangers, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.1.
<hi>Ezra</hi> forces thoſe guilty or defendant parties, even many of them not
guilty or complained of, to take an oath, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.5. he forces them
too in a cauſe, in which they might be convinced by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but
firſt he forces them. After that, as in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.
<hi>verſe, Eſdras</hi> with the reſt, to whom the care of that cauſe
was delegated, ſit upon the cauſe, which the third Moneth after they bring
to effect. Which form being uſed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> a ready Scribe, and
skilful in the Law of his God, it may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſires of any man not
unjuſt, as to the practice of the Law, as they ſpeak) and the knowledge of
the rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this is the former uſe of an oath, juſt and lawful,
in the ſettling of the foundation of a ſuit or controverſie.</p>
                        <p>The other is, when arguments are uſed to make good the
ſnit or controverſie begun. Now the arguments, or theſe Confirmations, to
which the Judge gives credit, are partly marks and preſumptions, (ſuch as
the nature of the cauſe bears) certain and undoubted, partly in corrupt and
ſound teſtimonies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Preſumptions</hi> or <hi>marks,</hi> ſuch as are
brought forth by the Parents in the caſe of the ſlandered Virgin,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies,</hi> upon whoſe credit the whole
action is confirmed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. In the number of which (I ſay of
Teſtimonies) I place an Oath, and that <hi>bounder of controverſie,</hi> or
(as they ſpeak) that <hi>deciſory oath of controverſie, Heb.</hi> 6.16.
The <hi>Hebrews</hi> out of the old Canon make two parts, or rather, if you
will, two kinds of an Oath.</p>
                        <p>The former is a ſolemn conteſtation, wherein any call
God to witneſſe for want of other witneſſes, who either cannot or will
not bear witneſſe, even God they call to witneſſe, who is preſent
every where and in all actions, and hath the right <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52848:50"/>of a
witneſſe: <hi>The Lord Jehova lives, before whom I ſpeak;</hi> this is a
form of conteſtation, <hi>Iudges</hi> 8.19. The later I may call it an
Execration, wherein a man gives oath to his conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or joyning
iſſue in the cauſe, as 'tis called) pawning as it were his ſalvation,
and renouncing all the hope and help he hath from God, if he bear witneſſe
falſly: <hi>So do the Lord to me, and ſo let him adde;</hi> there is a form
of Execration, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14 44. Neither have Divines thought it of
leſſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that the guilty or defendant party was leſſe
bound, whether he uſed either of thoſe forms, or both. I adde alſo,
whether the Magiſtrate conteſt the guilty or defendant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or by
adjuration he be execrated, or he do it to himſelf by taking an oath; for
'tis all one whether this or that be done: whether an oath be laid upon the
guilty or defendant party by the Judge, or he lay it upon himſelf. And that
they take for granted, as well by <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.24. in regard of the
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as by <hi>Iudges</hi> 17.2. by reaſon of the condition. But this
controverſie brings another: I proſecute not that, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that I
begun, touching Arguments.</p>
                        <p>Now God hath given power to the Judge to enquire of the
Arguments touching the crime, and of citing the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; as alſo to
the giving of oaths, and that for the collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>conſirmations</hi>
of the cauſe. That power is mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt
enquire</hi> (ſaith the Lord) and that in general; whereof he ſubjoynes two
kinds, the firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſearch,</hi> that is, <hi>preſumptions
and arguments.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Thou ſhalt aske,</hi> that is,
witneſſes and thoſe that are knowing of the paſſages concerning that
cauſe.</p>
                        <p>The Arguments. So it was lawful for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to
ſearch his Brethrens ſacks, that he might find the Cup taken away by theft,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 44.5. So is it lawful for our Magiſtrates to ſearch the
hidden corners and ſecreteſt rooms of the houſe, ſo to find out marks
or preſumptions of ſuſpected crimes.</p>
                        <p>Teſtimonies. So it is provided by Gods Law, <hi>Lev.</hi>
5.1. <hi>If a ſoul hear the voice of ſwearing</hi> (the Chaldee
Paraphraſt, a moſt ancient Interpreter of the Law, hath added to it, 
<note n="*" place="margin">Here feems to be ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
in the printed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note>nor where we have erred; nor is it to be doubted
but that it was according to the ſenſe of the ancient Church, even before 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52848:50"/>Chriſts time) <hi>made or given by the Judge, and he can
be a witneſs of that matter, as one that ſaw it and knew it,</hi> (in which
place the Septuagint turns the word <hi>knew it,</hi> into <hi>being
conſcious</hi> of it) <hi>if he that is ſo conſcious of it, ſhall be
called forth to give his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; if he reveal it not, he ſhall bear his
own imquity.</hi> Therefore 'tis lawful to make inquiſition, and upon
oath.</p>
                        <p>And firſt of all 'tis lawful to make Inquiſition
touching the party guilty or defendant, even amongſt others, though his
Brethren, though they be religious perſons; as <hi>Obadiah</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.10. <hi>There is no Nation or Kingdom
whither my Lord hath not ſent to ſeek thee, and when they ſaid, He is not
there, he took an oath of the Kingdom and Nation, that they found thee
not.</hi> And methinks 'tis likely, when this Oath was common to the whole
Kingdom, it fell alſo upon thoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, whoſe Knees were not
bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor had their lips kiſſed him, neither did they in
this cauſe (though it was to the prejudice of their <hi>Elias,</hi> and that
too before wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Magiſtrates) refuſe to give their teſtimony. Neither
is it onely lawful to enquire concerning the guilty or defendant party,
amongſt others onely; but alſo to enquire of him himſelf, concerning
himſelf. The great Judge gave us a precedent herein, in that firſt
Inquiſition that ever was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Who toldihee that thou
waſt naked? haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> So the Princes interrogated <hi>Baruch</hi> touching
<hi>Jeremiahs</hi> book, <hi>Tell us, how didſt thou write all theſe words
at his mouth?</hi> So <hi>Eſdras</hi> the very parties guilty or defendants
touching their own fact, <hi>Eſr.</hi> 10.11. So the High Prieſt committed
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>to enquire ſomething of him more
perfectly, Acts</hi> 23.20. For oftentimes Accuſers fall back, (which the
Heathen man long ſince obſerved:) All cannot, ſome will not accuſe;
what's to be done then? Some mens wickedneſſe, becauſe they are truly the
works of darkneſſe, nor can be brought to light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11.
becauſe <hi>they joyn hand in hand,</hi> nor will diſcover themſelves,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16.5. Becauſe the name of <hi>Doeg</hi> is harſh, and even
the very thing, <hi>to go forth to accuſe,</hi> is now become poor and
odious, a matter of coſt, danger and infamy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.8. And ſhall
we ſuffer wickedneſſe to lye hid and ſpred <pb n="84" facs="tcp:52848:51"/>abroad,
and by delay to gather ſtrength, till at length it break out to the ruine of
the Commonwealth? and becauſe no man can or will (for it is all one, whether
he will not or cannot accuſe) is't not lawful to enquire? ſurely 'tis
lawful. But 'tis in vain to enquire without the bond of an Oath. The Holy
Ghoſt in the old Teſtament expreſſes it by the word <hi>adjure,</hi>
and ſo the King adjured <hi>Micheas.</hi> In the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament alſo by
the word <hi>adjure,</hi> ſo the High Prieſt adjured our Saviour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.63. and they both made Religion of not anſwering to the
Queſtion. Touching the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word there is no queſtion, but that
both by the force of the name, and the uſe of it, it imports an Oath. I adde,
nor is there of the <hi>Greek</hi> word neither, if <hi>Beza</hi> and the
reſt of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, render right that requeſt of the Devil, which
is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>I adjure thee that thou torment me not:</hi> that
is, aſſure me by giving me an Oath or ſwearing to me, that thou wilt not
torment me. So ſeems it to them: but that term of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring I paſſe by. I
take the other (if it be another) of <hi>laying an Oath</hi> upon the party
guilty or defendant; that is, that by Law it is permitted to the party agent to
force him againſt his will to take an oath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.8. 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 8.31. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis more then permitted to the
Magiſtrate. Surely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad were the caſe of our affairs, if every private
man ſhould have power to require an oath of the party guilty or defendant,
and the Magiſtrate ſhould not have power: if in the caſe of a Pawn it
ſhould be lawful, and not of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: if one may be forced to ſwear,
that he hath not <hi>put his hand to his neighbours goods,</hi> and cannot be
forced to his oath, that he hath not put forth his hand to the peace of the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. If, as to the Law, his caſe be better that makes troubles in
the Church of God, then his that has done it about his friends money. Compare
theſe one with another: Firſt, the Magiſtrate, then the party agent, one
perhaps of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the common people; then the caſe of a mans
ſmall ſumme of money, and the caſe of the Commonwealth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that
Pawn ſometimes may ſomewhere be diſcovered, but thoſe clandeſtine
conſpiracies cannot (unleſs you grant ſuch Inquiſition) for that's
vaniſhed into the air, left no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52848:51"/>behind it.
Either I am very much miſtaken, or (whether you conſider the perſons or
the matter, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the events of the things) the equity and
neceſſity of an oath is here greater. Therefore that the party guilty or
defendant ſhould be ſo interrogated in his own cauſe, 'tis allowed by
Gods Law: and that alſo by the laying on an oath is lawful. And this laſt
uſe of an oath is juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not onely that the ſtate of the
queſtion may be ſettled by the anſwer of the party guilty or defendant,
(as before is laid down) but alſo that the confirmations of the cauſe, that
is, the pillars of the proofs may be gathered together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Judge
may relye to determine the ſuit on one ſide.</p>
                        <p>This may ſuffice for this purpoſe, unleſs that, as I
believe, there reſt one knot or another, not worthy the looſing: but that
(as the world goes now-a-adayes) every ſcruple that men make, becomes a rock;
they complain, that by theſe means men are compelled to <hi>an infinite
oath,</hi> except before hand they may have the Queſtion, and afterwards take
the Oath. The reaſon hereof I have given before, and therefore will not here
repeat it: This onely I maintain, that the uſual oath given cannot be
declined by reaſon of Infinity. For whileſt thoſe bounds, and as it were
ends of an oath, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2.
(which alwayes in Divinity were accounted the bounds, and as it were the ends
of an oath) <hi>in truth, juſtice and judgment:</hi> whileſt theſe were
obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there was caution enough had: nor other ends doth the Scripture
acknowledge or require.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>In Truth:</hi> that is, truly. That no man be
compelled to ſwear contrary to that he knows; as it was charged upon
<hi>Micheas,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.16. <hi>Tell me nothing but truth in the
name of the Lord.</hi> Or if any man like better that Atteſtation of St.
<hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my
conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alſo bearing me witneſs in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> This is
enough for the firſt part.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>In Juſtice:</hi> that is, juſtly. That
nothing be ſworn but what is poſſible: in which caſe <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſervant took care, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.5. Perhaps <hi>the woman will not be
willing to follow me, &amp;c.</hi> The Heathen themſelves too had that
caution, <hi>So far as I know <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52848:52"/>and am able.</hi> And alſo
to the honeſty of it; wherein they in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. made proviſion,
that is, <hi>According to the Law.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Acts</hi>
23.3. <hi>Commandeſt thou me to be ſmitten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law?</hi> This
is ſufficient for the ſecond part.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>In Judgment:</hi> that is, maturely not
raſhly; (for ſo do the Interpreters diſtinguiſh it.) Of which, ſayes
<hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 5.1. whileſt thou art ſpeaking to God, <hi>Be not
raſh with thy mouth;</hi> but taking due time to deliberate thereupon,
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Theſe are the ends of an oath, which the Scripture acknowledges;
nor do they require more, as it is defined, if theſe three ends be kept: 1.
<hi>I will speak nothing but truth in the name of the Lord:</hi> 2. Of ſuch
things I know and as far as I am able, and according to Law: 3. Taking ſo
much time to think on't, that there can be no danger from an infinity or
endleſneſſe. Though every petty queſtion is not clear, (which often
happens from the occaſion) 'twill be ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to contain within theſe
bounds; not to anſwer any thing falſly or raſhly, nor to anſwer
concerning ſuch things which he remembers not, or is not bound by Law to it:
that is, he will do that, which without an oath he is bound to do. And he that
deſires to be more ſafe then thus, in my judgment rather deſires to
arrogate an infinite liberty, then to decline an infinite oath; or he is
guilty, or ſomething elſe that I will not ſpeak of.</p>
                        <p>And now, whileſt thou art taking care how to avoid a ſin
by ſwearing, I think it matters not much, whether before hand thou
promiſeſt by a <hi>promiſſory oath</hi> to ſpeak truth, or
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards thou ſweareſt by an <hi>aſſertory oath,</hi> that that
which thou haſt ſpoken is true: It comes to the ſame paſſe before
anſwer, by <hi>promiſſory oath</hi> to promiſe to deal truly, or after
anſwer by an <hi>aſſertory oath</hi> to atteſt, that thou haſt dealt
truly: I have ſaid, and I will ſay; I have done, and I will do: there are
two times, but the Oath is the ſame. Wherefore as to the matter I think it
matters not much, yet thus far it may, that it much conduces to the managing of
ſuits at Law, both that they may be clear and explicite, as alſo readily
diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That they may be clear and explicite, leſt (if the party
guilty or defendant, being not tyed by the bond of an Oath, <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52848:52"/>may ſeem to be at liberty to prevaricate) the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
action may float up and down, and have neither foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation nor hinge. That they
may be readily diſpatched, leſt (in caſe the party guilty having
anſwered, will not ſwear to the truth of his anſwer) the Judge ſhould
be compelled oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to iterate the queſtions, and act the ſame thing over
and over. It is alſo conſiderable too, becauſe in that form of judgment,
which is moſt agreeable to Gods Law,<note place="margin">Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ezra</hi> 10.13. that he might not be neceſſitated upon the
judgment-ſeat, to give anſwer to all queſtions: It was tedious, not the
work of one day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after he had in a ſolemn place given them the
oath, they might come afterwards at leaſure, at times appointed, and enquiry
might be made into the ſeveral circumſtances of the fact, by virtue of the
oath before taken. The ſame practice is uſed now by us, and the ſame
cuſtom prevails; which, whether you look upon the advice, is moſt juſt;
or the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, it is moſt like the Divine Law. For if the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt go before the Oath, (ſo that it ſhould be unlawful for any to take
an oath but in open Court) ſurely one day would ſcarce ſuffice for one
cauſe, and the people (contrary to <hi>Jethro's</hi> advice) ſhould ſtand
in judgment from morning to the evening.</p>
                        <p>That laſt is, which ſome (doubtleſs for want of
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) would have the Oath ſo given them; that after they had
taken the Oath, there ſhould be no farther enquiry: And this they hold,
grounding themſelves upon that ſentence of St. <hi>Paul, An Oath is the end
of all ſtrife.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> I ſtand not upon it
that it may be ſo interpreted, that the original Greek word there
<hi>peràs,</hi> rather is the <hi>State</hi> of the Controverſie then
the <hi>End</hi> of it: But be it ſo, the end; let the Oath be the end, 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52848:53"/>but not every Oath, or by whomſoever taken, or
howſoever performed (this can ſcarcely be thought to proceed from a man in
his right wits) but I hope it muſt be ſuch an Oath, of the credit whereof
there may be no contradiction: in caſe the <hi>Contradiction</hi> ought to be
ended by that Oath. Wherefore if the Judge muſt end the Suite or
Controverſie without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, it muſt be ſo clear, that no man
even without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, or after Examination, will or can contradict it. For
to deſire to free every Oath of every man from all Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, what is it
but to plead for perjury? What elſe is it, but as it were upon warning given,
ſo by this kind of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority given; to ſollicite men of looſe
Conſciences to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this wickedneſſe? For whether the Actor, or
Defendent, or Witneſs take it, the Oath is of the ſame Conſcience, of the
ſame face, there's an end: if one will ſwear that what he ſues for, or
complaines of is his, is true, preſently he carries the Cauſe: But
afterwards, it muſt be unlawful to enquire whether he hath ſworn true or
no, <hi>Becauſe an Oath is the end of all Controverſie.</hi> If this be
granted, it makes well for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured men. Let them make their peace with God as
well as they can; from the Law they need fear nothing, nor ſhall be
puniſhed by the eare for what they ſinned by their mouth. How juſter is
that? Yea truly if the Oath be ſound, let the Inquiſition thereupon be
twice, or thrice, or ſeaven times, if it be thought fit, it will alwayes as
out of a furnace come forth more clear and pure, and the very Inquſition it
ſelf, will become an acquiſition of more credit. But if the Oath be not of
good, but doubtful credit or ſuſpected: Let it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and let
<hi>Juſtice break unjust bonds.</hi> Surely this is reaſon, and is it only
reaſon? Doth not the Law ſay the ſame? Whether one contend by oath,
either in his own cauſe for himſelf, or in anothers againſt another for
himſelf. For himſelf: The woman of ſuſpected chaſtity, when ſhe had
upon her oath denyed the adultery, laying a moſt heavy curſe upon her
ſelf if ſhe were guilty; was ſhe thereupon preſently diſmiſs'd?
(for an Oath is the end of all controverſie:) No, a new queſtion was made,
whether ſhe had ſworn truly or no? for proof whereof ſhe was to drink the
Bitter waters, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52848:53"/>which would be the confirmers of the Oath if
true, and the revengers if falſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.24.</p>
                        <p>Againſt another: When the Law had provided, that out of
the mouth of two or three witneſſes, who being ſworn had given
teſtimony againſt a man, the matter ſhould be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. Leſt any man ſhould take humane teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for
Divine Oracles, in the next Verſe 'tis commanded, that the ſuſpected
witneſſe muſt ſtand before the Lord, the Prieſts, and it muſt be
enquired into whether he hath carried himſelf ſincerely and truly in the
teſtimony he hath given; but if he be convicted of falſity, then ſhall he
be puniſhed as he ſhould have been whom he complained of. But I ſhall
tranſgreſs upon the time, and upon the Church too, (the Clock having a
while ago called us off) if I ſhould further follow theſe trifles, which
whoever liſt may bray with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they of their own accord ſo
overflow: therefore I reſtore you to your ſelves and conclude. If (as the
Prophet ſaith)<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.17.</note> this Judgment, which we
uſe, be laid to the Line, and Righteouſneſſe to the Plummet of Gods
Word, there ſhall be in thoſe things no ſin. For the Magiſtrate to
require, and that from the party guilty or defendant, (eſpecially if the
cauſe be not capital, or a cauſe of Bloud) an Oath; and that he may do it
ſo far, whether it be that the controverſie may thereby be ſet upon its
foundation, whileſt the ſtate of the cauſe is ſought for: or that the
truth of the proofs may be made evident, whileſt the queſtion is handled.
Nor does the ends of the Oath, or the order, or the examination, offend
againſt Divinity, and therefore cannot be declined. They that decline it,
firſt they do it out of ignorance of Gods Law: then the example is dangerous,
that one may thus for his pleaſure enquire into publick judgments without
judgment: if we may call into queſtion the reſt of the affairs of the
Kingdom, and the moments of the Commonwealth: laſtly the Law it ſelf if it
make not for us. That God Almighty may avert this from us, to whom turning our
ſelves let us pray, that he will give us grace to be modeſtly wiſe and
ſober in all things, to ſee in our minds how irreligious it is, how
unchriſtian to decline the judgments of our Nation: but rather with all 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52848:54"/>our endeavour, with all the ſtrength and force of our Wit
to maintain them, which maintain the Commonwealth and us all; for next after

is hoped that Act may be thought fit to be reviſed and re-examined, and
perhaps altered: ſo with the like humility, all that is ſaid or ſhall be
ſaid in this Treatiſe, is moſt ſubmiſly tendered to His Sacred
Majeſty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this happy

            <p>Should any man object, That ſome Civilians deſired that this
Act, whereby the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> and Purgation is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, ſhould
paſſe at the end of the receſs of Parliament, the latter end of this
laſt Summer, 1661. when many other Acts of great concernment were in
agitation, and ſome then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſome ſtayed, ſuppoſed that
they will be reſumed and conſidered of at the next meeting of Parliament:
that, I ſay, this Act ſhould not ſtay (as ſome would have had it) till
that next meeting, but rather paſs now, though with theſe
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo's</hi> on it. I can ſay no more then this, that <hi>Certa
incertis praferenda;</hi> if they could not have all they would have, yet to
have ſomething, that in a manner wanted all, was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable prudence:
it had perhaps ſavoured of moroſity to <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52848:54"/>have done
otherwiſe, eſpecially conſidering that thoſe that have long faſted
would be glad to eat; though, I hope, theſe that adminiſtred this food to
them, did not fear they would (as hungry men uſe to do) feed too faſt, to
their hurt, not to their nouriſhment, and therefore did ſet the leſs meat
before them; but upon a pauſe after this refreſhment there may be a
ſupply: Neither need (I humbly conceive) any thing that is already done,
hinder the review or alteration of this Act in that point. For it is no new
thing nor diſcommendable, (but contrary) to make Laws upon preſent
reaſons or emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and yet upon future accidents or contingencies, and
variation of the times and occaſions, and other neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites,
which could not well be foreſeen at the making of theſe Laws, nor perhaps
dreamt on till they happened; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, change or repeal the former. Hereof
many inſtances might be given, but in ſo plain a caſe I ſhall mention

                        <p>Therefore it is thought moſt convenient to the Kings

for this time be with diligence provided <pb n="92" facs="tcp:52848:55"/>for, whereby many
inconveniences have enſued, and many moe elſe mought enſue and follow: as
where heretofore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and many perſons, after long continuance together in
Matrimony, without any allegation of either of the parties, or any other at
their marriage, why the ſame matrimony ſhould not be good, juſt and
lawful, and after the ſame Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſolemnized, and conſummate by
carnal knowledge, and alſo ſometime fruit of children enſued of the
ſame Marriage, upon pretence of a former contract made, and not conſummate
by carnal copulation, (for proof whereof two witneſſes by that Law were
onely required) béen divorced and ſeparate, contrary to Gods Law, and
ſo the true Matrimony, both ſolemnized in the face of the Church, and
conſummate with bodily know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and confirmed alſo with the fruit of
children had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen them, clearly fruſtrate and diſſolved:
Further alſo, by reaſon of other prohibitions then Gods Law admitteth, for
their lucre by that Court invented, the diſpenſations whereof they alwayes
reſerved to themſelves, as in kindred or affinity betwéen
Couſin-germans, and ſo to the fourth and fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée, carnal

                  <p>Such a Parliament acting regularly, is't not probable the

Proteſtation unjuſtly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Members kept out of the Houſe,
by force, that ſo proteſted and petitioned, whether the other Members could
then have proceeded further in the Houſe?</p>
                  <p>In the late Kings time, in the beginning of his Reign, when
the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was impriſoned in the Tower, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his ſons

without the Kings conſent; the Lords would do nothing in their Houſe till
he was reſtored, in regard he was committed onely for a miſdemeanour, and
neither for Treaſon, Felony, nor breach of peace, in which caſes they then
confeſſed, a Member of Parliament in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time might be kept
priſoner. 
<note place="margin">The King none of the three

<hi>Eliz.</hi> 3. and elſewhere, and the King being none of the three
Eſtates, (the contrary whereof hath been falſly held) but the Head, and the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, being but Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and further,
the Lords Spiritual being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Eſtates of the Realm, as 8
<hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. Some doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of the Eſtates can deſtroy

Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be <hi>Felo de ſe:</hi> whether that concerns not the
Lords Temporal and Commons, as well as the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual? As for His late

then carried that, and other things too, to the miſery of the Kingdom: Who
knows not in what condition the King then was? forced to flye by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of
the tumults from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to remoter places.</p>
                  <p>And as touching that Act of Parliament for their expulſion
out of the Lords Houſe, it is not to be forgotten, that when it was firſt
brought into the Lords Houſe it was rejected, and ought not to have been
brought in again that Seſſion; yet afterwards it was contrary to the order
and courſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought in again when a great part of the Lords
were <pb n="99" facs="tcp:52848:61"/>abſent, if not upon juſt fears frighted out of the
Houſe; and it being ſcarce ſafe for the King to deny them any thing, in
that dangerous condition he was then in. As alſo that ſuch Conceſſions
or Acts as then, contrary to the Kings free will, were wreſted from the King,
were not to be accounted legal, or good, or valid; whereof ſeveral
inſtances may be given heretofore of ſuch, and amongſt the reſt one 15
<hi>E.</hi> 3. the King then yielded to and granted certain Articles, pretended
at leaſt to have the form of an Act or Statute of Parliament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
contrary to the Laws of the Realm, and his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to which he had
aſſented to eſchew the dangers, which by denying the ſame were like to
follow: in the ſame Parliament it was repealed in theſe very words
following; <hi>It ſeemed good to the ſaid Earls, Barons, and other wiſe
men, that ſince the Statute did not proceed of our good will, the ſame be
void, and ought not to have the name or ſtrength of a Statute, and therefore
by their counſel and aſſent we have decreed the ſaid Statute to be
void, &amp;c.</hi> And perhaps it deſerves to be thought of, how far in this
caſe that Act of 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. reaches, where it is ſet
down, that <hi>the great Charter ſhould be kept in all points, and if any
Statute be made to the contrary, it ſhall be holden for none.</hi> And one
eſpecial Law in that Charter is, for the preſervation of the rights and
liberties of the Church, whereof this of the Lords Spiritual, their liberty of
ſitting and voting in the Lords Houſe, is a known ſpecial liberty and
privilege, and moſt ancient.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Proceedings of the Houſe of
Commons.</note>If we look back to the Long Parliament, was it not fit that that
Houſe of Commons ſhould have been juſtly regulated to act no further or
otherwiſe, then according to their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Commiſſion and
Summons by which they were called? which Commiſſion or Writ of Summons is
the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all power in Parliaments, as it is well expreſſed by the
Lords and Commons aſſembled at <hi>Oxford, Declaration of the Treaty,
p.</hi> 15. What fearful exorbitances have been that way, the more ſad it is
to remember, the more care ought to be taken to prevent it for the future. The
Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in former times being deſired by the Lords Honſe to
conſult with them <hi>de arduis regni negotiis,</hi> to which the Lords 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52848:62"/>are called, and the Houſe of Commons remembring their
call and commiſſion, <hi>ad conſentiendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hiis quae tunc &amp; ibidem,
&amp;c.</hi> as in their Writ of Summons, humbly referred it back to the Lords
as matters too high for them. And it may ſeem againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and
gravity of Parliaments, or either Houſe, as alſo to the grievance of the
Subject, for both or either Houſe, or the Committees of either of them, as in
the Long Parliament, to trouble themſelves with matters of very ſmall or
inferiour nature, much below them, and in caſes where the Law hath
ſufficiently provided remedy, and is ſtill in force to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the
proper Judges. Were it in making new Laws thereabouts, that ought to be ſo:
but I mean in making or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about the execution of ſuch Laws, which properly
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ordinary Judges thereof, and are uſnally executed by them,
eſpecially touching inferiour matters, it look'd then in that Long
Parliament, as though they would have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all other courts, and
made a kind of <hi>Juſtitium</hi> in them, during the time of their
Seſſion; ſuch as medling with the appointing of Churchwardens, and ſuch
like petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The late Long Parliament deviated much, eſpecially the
pretended Houſe of Commons, then to omit, as being too notoriouſly
deplorable, the Iliads of miſeries this poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath thereby undergone,
beſides that horrid one of the murther of our late King, of ever bleſſed
memory, King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, acted by a pretended Houſe of
Commons. Was not that then too frequently practiſed worthy then of
reformation? that is, the judiciary power being in the Lords Houſe, and the
Commons Houſe having power onely over their own Members in ſome caſes,
and not having power ſo much as to give an Oath; yet how often did they then
upon ſmall matters, unworthy of their cogniſance, in regard they might have
been ſo eaſily remedied by the known ordinary Laws of the Land, and the
ordinary competent Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, call orthodox, conformable and worthy
Miniſters, to appear before them from very diſtant remote places,
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times near upon 200. miles, for ſetting a rail about the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table, according to the command of the Ordinary; or matters of ſuch inferiour
nature: theſe brought on and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <pb n="101" facs="tcp:52848:62"/>by
Inconformiſts then, to the great miſchief to this Nation, too too much
favoured, promoted and proſecuted by the then prevailing power. The Fees and
charges were then very high, inſomuch as ſome Miniſters were almoſt, if
not altogether, undone, before they could get up thither; and when they came,
by reaſon of multiplicity of buſineſſe in the Commons Houſe, they
ſtaid there long and upon great charge, paying high Fees ſtill to the
Serjeant or other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Houſe, whileſt they lay under
reſtraint, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes was very long. When a charge after long delay
was given in, then they gave their anſwer, after a long ſtay too: Then a
Committee of many Members was appointed to examine witneſſes, which was
done without oath; then after a long time the cauſe was reported, many of
theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not having heard the whole cauſe, but ſome one part,
ſome another; yet often concurring at the voting and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe
to the Houſe of Commons: which was a ſtrange kind of proceeding, to call it
no worſe. In the Star-chamber and High-commiſſion none uſed to give
ſentence but ſuch as heard all the cauſe, and they uſually excuſed
themſelves when they had not heard all the cauſe. Now, when the Houſe of
Commods had proceeded thus far upon the matter, yet they had done little or
nothing, but vexed and undone a poor and perhaps guiltleſs Miniſter: for
they were to tranſmit the cauſe to the Lords Houſe, and there to begin it
<hi>de novo,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the witneſſes again upon oath, which, as before,
the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe could not do. And here 'tis to be conſidered, whether or
no it were not <hi>anceps perjurium,</hi> a dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to
witneſſes, that perhaps have ſpoken too largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſworn, will,
if but for fear of loſs of Reputation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm upon Oath what they have
ſaid without Oath. It is to be feared alſo, ſome poor men foreſeeing
this unevitable courſe of undoing them, have either wronged their owne
cauſe, and betrayed their innocence, by confeſſing themſelves guilty;
or, <hi>ad redimendam vexationem,</hi> compounded with their proſecutors,
even to their own undoing, or well nigh. If there had been cauſe, and that it
could not properly in an ordinary way have been remedied by the proper
competent <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52848:63"/>ordinary Judges; why ſhould not the cauſe
have been begun, heard and determined in the Lords Houſe at firſt?</p>
                  <p>Could the Houſes, eſpecially the Commons Houſe, then
have been brought into ſuch due order, as not to act <hi>extra ſpheram
activitatis ſuae,</hi> 'tis well to be hoped they would not, as above, have
been deſirous to lengthen or perpetuate that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when they can, as
by right, repeal no old, nor make no new Law, nor tax the Subjects eſtate,
nor make Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have the force of Laws, without His Majeſties
aſſent. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth ſuffered the Houſes of
Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for a matter of two years or thereabouts, to
continue petitioning him to diſſolve them and diſmiſs them home, which
he would not do till he ſaw cauſe. Though this is not in his commendation,
yet hereby the juſt power of the King appeared, and the right of his
Prerogative, which hath been too long and too much trampled upon. And ſurely
the Law in this point is the ſame in <hi>Englaud</hi> as in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
that the juſt bounds and limits on all ſides might be preſerved
inviolate.</p>

ends, much by ſurpriſes, when too many Members, <pb n="105" facs="tcp:52848:64"/>either
wearied out, as before; or elſe gone out, ither upon their pleaſure or
private concernments; or thereupon abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the Houſe,
then the Houſe being thin'd according to their deſires, they eaſily
gained the major part of the ſuffrages, or elſe clap'd in early into the
Houſe, whileſt the negligent party were in bed, or abſent upon their
private buſineſs, neglecting the publick to which they were called; and
ſo carried it, and by ſuch like wayes contrived and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their
laboured ends, perhaps by their engines ſo laid, to draw away many, whoſe
company they would gladly have been rid of, out of the Houſe, and to keep
them out when ſo abſent, or to hinder them from coming in at all. Such may
not improperly be called Parliament Decoyes, or rather, as in that Long
Parliament, when ſome of the Members impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched eleven of their number, upon
one of them in the charge againſt him they fixed the <hi>ſtigma</hi> of the
<hi>Parliament-driver,</hi> and when it made for them, imputed it to him for a
crime.</p>
                  <p>It would be voluminous to reckon up the ſeveral ſpecies of
the ſiniſter artifices and gins, which were then dexterouſly us'd in that
Long Parliament, to promote unrighteous ends; very often by tumults, which were
at the beſt of ſome factious perſons, by clamours and menaces, as it
were, to force away ſuch Members as they knew would oppoſe their deſigns.
By Petitions too, which were but a kind of Tumults too in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſs, and
moſt ſhamefully carried on and gained many times; whether we conſider the
inconſiderableneſs of the Petitioners, Oyſter-women, Barbers,
School-boyes, (as in ſome Petitions againſt Biſhops) if not others, as
much if not more contemptible: or whether we conſider the number of the
Petitioners, many ſubſcribing them that knew nothing of the contents of the
Petition, if not ſometimes giving power, with a ſtrange implicite faith, to
cerrain men of their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſet to their hands to what Petitions
ſoever their party ſhould frame; the Petitions perhaps framed in
<hi>London,</hi> and never ſent into the Country, but thouſands of hands
ſent up in Schedules, to be put to whatſoever the framers ſhould
pleaſe; if not alſo, which is much the ſame, ſome Petitions ſent up
out of far diſtant remote parts from <hi>London,</hi> with very many 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52848:65"/>hands ſubſcribed, and the Petitions after they were
come up to <hi>London</hi> altered, and yet the ſame hands continued or ſet
to it: Inſomuch as in the time of that Long Parliament it was at leaſt once
obſerved, that ſome Petitions, or a Petition, with ſome thouſands of
hands ſubſcribed, and coming from ſome parts remote from <hi>London,</hi>
and brought into the Houſe of Commons, and there read in the morning, took
notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentioned in the body of the Petition, of ſome paſſages of
words ſpoken in the Houſe the foregoing evening: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one merrily
asked, What notable Mercury had that laſt night gone from <hi>London</hi>
into thoſe remote parts, and got ſo many hands in a nights time, and
brought them back thither that morning? This did almoſt put ſome to the

contain equal numbers, if that may be, at leaſt each ſeat of the ſide,
ſo many and each at the end, ſo many equally. It is quickly determined, by
ſeeing how many ſeats are filled, or how many are in ſuch ſeats:
whether the number required to be at the paſſing ſuch Vote, be then there
or not. The ſeats for Privy Counſellors may, notwithſtanding this, be
diſtinct and kept for them, and for Committees ſome ſuch courſe to be

                  <p>In the Lords Houſe ſuch diſtinctions of ſeats and

Commiſſions granted by others, and yet here they look like equal and eaven

                  <p>It is obvious to every eye, how ſome have ſweat to have

what ſtrange interpretations have been made of theſe Oaths, as that they
were made onely againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power, and as though nothing elſe were
to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And in the beginning of the Rebellion in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the orthodox Divines of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> maintaining,
according to that Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That in no caſe
the King is to be reſiſted, and that ſo to do was contrary to Gods Word,
and to the opinion and practice of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: The other
Divines, fomentors of that Rebellion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denied this, and alledged that
the reaſon why the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians reſiſted not, was becauſe
<hi>deerant illis vires;</hi> the very ſame reaſon that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
gives for the ſame: ſo well do theſe two Factions concur. Though by the
Hiſtory of thoſe times it appears, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> openly pleads it
againſt the Emperor, that it was not for want of ſtrength, for they had
enough, but that it was contrary to their conſcience, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Gods Word,
ſo to reſiſt. And therefore why not much need, that all perſons
whatſoever ſhould take this Oath, to declare their opinion in this
point?</p>

<hi>In ore unius vel duorum teſtium,</hi> as <hi>duorum vel trium,</hi> if he
had thought it ſo fitting: and yet (as before) the Goſpel ſeems to pinch
harder then the Law. To that Objection, That then many Malefactors would
eſcape; it may be anſwered, That ſecret things belong to the Lord, and to
him they are to be left, and that it is better ten Knaves ſhould eſcape,
then one guiltleſs man ſhould be hanged. We have ſeen and heard, how even
in a manner miraculouſly God hath often revealed murther and great crimes,
that we may ſuppoſe, that when ſuch crimes cannot be in the ordinary way
detected, it pleaſes God they ſhall be done extraordinarily. Many
inſtances might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the ſad conſequences, by putting to death

'tis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported: A young man, a Lawyers Clerk, made love to a
Gentlewomans Chamber-maid, and a fellow-ſervant of the Chamber-maids, keeping
company much with her, and the young man uſing alſo kind dalliance towards
her, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he loved her better then the Chamber-maid; but
afterwards perceiving ſhe was miſtaken, ſhe boyled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
againſt him, and the Devil watching as a roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom he may devour,
inſtigated her to accuſe him of theft, that he had ſtoln from her
Maſters houſe, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way under his Cloak a Silver Boll: Upon this
bare ſingle teſtimony of hers the Jury found him guilty, he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and dyed for it. Not long after the Chamber-maid, grieving for the loſs of
her eſpouſed husband, ſeeing her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants Trunk or Box
unlocked, lift up the Cover, and there ſaw that very Boll, which ſhe very
well knew, for which the young man was condemned and ſuffered; ſhe calls up
her maſter, who found it to be the ſame Boll, which ſhe, he ſhewing it
to her, could not deny; upon this ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, condemned and
ſuffered death; and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid fell mad with grief, and dyed: And all
this came from this judgment upon the teſtimony of a ſingle witneſſe.
Should any object, That this might happen upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of two or more
witneſſes: It is poſſible, but not ſo probable; and the ſafe way is
to follow the Rule afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe of Treaſon two witneſſes are required, and
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite: and in other crimes, capital eſpecially when alſo in
many caſes that are not capital two witneſſes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why might it
not be reaſonably expected? though the atrocity of Treaſon is high, yet as
to the perſon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering the puniſhment by loſſe of
life is little different.</p>

oftentimes expreſly deny to follow the Judges directions, but go quite
contrary: but I ſpare to inſtance them, in reverence to the Law under which

publiſhed by <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> if not by others too, affirming the power
of Juries, not as is commonly held, to be onely in matter of fact, but in
matter of Law too; and how they have controuled learned Judges in their

that Axiom, <hi>Ex facto jus oritur,</hi> hath been extremely rack'd. The
